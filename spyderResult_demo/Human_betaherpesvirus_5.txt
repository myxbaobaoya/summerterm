Human betaherpesvirus  also called human cytomegalovirus HCMV is species of virus in the genus Cytomegalovirus which in turn is a member of the viral family known as Herpesviridae or herpesviruses  It is also commonly called CMV Within Herpesviridae HCMV belongs to the Betaherpesvirinae subfamily which also includes cytomegaloviruses from other mammals CMV is a doublestranded DNA virus
Although they may be found throughout the body HCMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands HCMV infection is typically unnoticed in healthy people but can be lifethreatening for the immunocompromised such as HIVinfected persons organ transplant recipients or newborn infants Congenital cytomegalovirus infection can lead to significant morbidity and even death After infection HCMV remains latent within the body throughout life and can be reactivated at any time Eventually it may cause mucoepidermoid carcinoma and possibly other malignancies such as prostate cancer and breast cancer
HCMV is found in all geographic locations and all socioeconomic groups and infects between  and  of adults in developed countries and almost  in developing countries
Of all herpes viruses HCMV harbors the most genes dedicated to altering evading innate and adaptive host immunity and represents a lifelong burden of antigenic T cell surveillance and immune dysfunction
Commonly it is indicated by the presence of antibodies in the general population Seroprevalence is agedependent  of individuals aged  and older are infected with CMV while  of individuals aged  and older are positive for HCMV HCMV is also the virus most frequently transmitted to a developing fetus
HCMV infection is more widespread in developing countries and in communities with lower socioeconomic status and represents the most significant viral cause of birth defects in industrialized countries Congenital HCMV is the leading infectious cause of deafness learning disabilities and intellectual disability in children
CMV also "seems to have a large impact on immune parameters in later life and may contribute to increased morbidity and eventual mortality"
Human betaherpesvirus  infection has a classic triad of symptoms fever peaking in the late afternoon or early evening pharyngitis usually exudative and symmetrical adenopathycitation needed
The mode of HCMV transmission from person to person is unknown but is presumed to occur through bodily fluids including saliva urine blood and tears Cytomegalovirus is most commonly transmitted through kissing and sexual intercourse It can also be transferred from an infected mother to her unborn child Infection requires close intimate contact with a person secreting the virus in their saliva urine or other bodily fluids CMV can be transmitted sexually and via breast milk and also occurs through receiving transplanted organs or blood transfusions Although HCMV is not highly contagious it has been shown to spread in households and among young children in day care centers
HCMV replicates within infected endothelial cells at a slow rate taking about  days in cell culture Like other herpesviruses HCMV expresses genes in a temporally controlled manner Immediate early genes – hours after infection are involved in the regulation of transcription followed by early genes – hours after infection which are involved in viral DNA replication and further transcriptional regulation Late genes are expressed during the remainder of infection up to viral egress and typically code for structural proteins  While HCMV encodes for its own functional DNA polymerase the virus makes use of the host RNA polymerase for the transcription of all of its genes
Synthesis of the viral doublestranded DNA genome occurs at the host cell nucleus within specialized viral replication compartments
Nearly  of the genes encoded by HCMV strain AD can be deleted and still result in the production of infectious virus This suggests that the virus focuses on avoiding the host immune system for a timely entrance into latencycitation needed
CMV infections are most significant in the perinatal period and in people who are immunocompromised
HCMV is one of the vertically transmitted infections that lead to congenital abnormalities Others are Toxoplasmosis Rubella and Herpes simplex Congenital HCMV infection occurs when the mother suffers a primary infection during pregnancycitation needed
Up to  of every  live births are infected Five percent develop multiple handicaps and develop cytomegalic inclusion disease with nonspecific signs that resemble rubella Another five percent later develop cerebral calcification decreasing IQ levels dramatically and causing sensorineural deafness and psychomotor retardationcitation needed
However infants born preterm and infected with HCMV after birth may experience cognitive and motor impairments later in life
CMV infection or reactivation in people whose immune systems are compromisedfor example people who have received transplants or are significantly burnedcauses illness and increases the risk of death
CMV reactivation is commonly seen in people with severe colitis
Specific disease entities recognized in those people are
People without CMV infection who are given organ transplants from CMVinfected donors require prophylactic treatment with valganciclovir ideally or ganciclovir and regular serological monitoring to detect a rising CMV titre if treated early establishment of a potentially lifethreatening infection can be preventedcitation needed
CMV infections can still be of clinical significance in adult immunocompetent populations
The question of whether latent CMV infection has any negative effects on people who are otherwise healthy has been debated as of  the answer was not clear but discussions had focused on whether latent CMV might increase the risk of some cardiovascular diseases and cancers
Most healthy people who are infected by HCMV after birth have no symptoms Some develop a syndrome similar to infectious mononucleosis or glandular fever with prolonged fever and a mild hepatitis A sore throat is common After infection the virus remains latent in lymphocytes in the body for the rest of the persons life Overt disease rarely occurs unless immunity is suppressed either by drugs infection or old age Initial HCMV infection which often is asymptomatic is followed by a prolonged inapparent infection during which the virus resides in mononuclear cells without causing detectable damage or clinical illnesscitation needed
Infectious CMV may be shed in the bodily fluids of any infected person and can be found in urine saliva blood tears semen and breast milk The shedding of virus can occur intermittently without any detectable signs or symptoms
CMV infection can be demonstrated microscopically by the detection of intranuclear inclusion bodies On HE staining the inclusion bodies stain dark pink and are called "owls eye" inclusion bodies
HCMV infection is important to certain highrisk groups Major areas of risk of infection include prenatal or postnatal infants and immunocompromised individuals such as organ transplant recipients persons with leukemia or those infected with human immunodeficiency virus HIV In HIV infected persons HCMV is considered an AIDSdefining infection indicating that the Tcell count has dropped to low levels
Lytically replicating viruses disrupt the cytoskeleton causing massive cell enlargement which is the source of the virus name
A study published in  links infection with CMV to high blood pressure in mice and suggests that the result of CMV infection of blood vessel endothelium in humans is a major cause of atherosclerosis Researchers also found that when the cells were infected with CMV they created renin a protein known to contribute to high blood pressure
Human CMV causes cellular senescence which could contribute to chronic inflammation inflammaging Human CMV is also linked to ageassociated T cell dysfunction contributing to immunosenescence COVID symptom severity is associated with CMV although the exact mechanism has not been elucidated
CMV encodes a protein UL which is involved in the immune evasion of NK cell responses It binds to ligands ULBP ULBP and MICB of NK cell activating receptor NKGD which prevents their surface expression These ligands are normally upregulated in times of cellular stress such as in viral infection and by preventing their upregulation CMV can prevent its host cell from dying due to NK cells
A substantial portion of the immune system is involved in continuously controlling CMV which drains the resources of the immune system Death rates from infectious disease accelerate with age and CMV infection correlates with reduced effectiveness of vaccination Persons with the highest levels of CMV antibodies have a much higher risk of death from all causes compared with persons having few or no antibodies
Most infections with CMV go undiagnosed as the virus usually produces few if any symptoms and tends to reactivate intermittently without symptoms Persons who have been infected with CMV develop antibodies to the virus which persist in the body for the lifetime of that individual A number of laboratory tests that detect these antibodies to CMV have been developed to determine if infection has occurred and are widely available from commercial laboratories In addition the virus can be cultured from specimens obtained from urine throat swabs bronchial lavages and tissue samples to detect active infection Both qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction PCR testing for CMV are available as well allowing physicians to monitor the viral load of people infected with CMV
The CMV pp antigenemia test is an immunofluorescencebased assay which utilizes an indirect immunofluorescence technique for identifying the pp protein of cytomegalovirus in peripheral blood leukocytes The CMV pp assay is widely used for monitoring CMV infection and its response to antiviral treatment in people who are under immunosuppressive therapy and have had renal transplantation surgery as the antigenemia results are obtained about  days before the onset of symptomatic CMV disease The advantage of this assay is the rapidity in providing results in a few hours and that the pp antigen determination represents a useful criterion for the physician to initiate antiviral therapy The major disadvantage of the pp assay is that only a limited number of samples can be processed per test batch
CMV should be suspected if a person has symptoms of infectious mononucleosis but has negative test results for mononucleosis and Epstein–Barr virus or if they show signs of hepatitis but have negative test results for hepatitis A B and C
For best diagnostic results laboratory tests for CMV antibody should be performed by using paired serum samples One blood sample should be taken upon suspicion of CMV and another one taken within  weeks A virus culture can be performed any time the person is symptomatic Laboratory testing for antibodies to CMV can be performed to determine if a woman has already had CMV infection However routine testing of all pregnant women is costly and the need for testing should therefore be evaluated on a casebycase basis
The enzymelinked immunosorbent assay or ELISA is the most commonly available serologic test for measuring antibody to CMV The result can be used to determine if acute infection prior infection or passively acquired maternal antibody in an infant is present Other tests include various fluorescence assays indirect hemagglutination PCR and latex agglutinationcitation needed
An ELISA technique for CMVspecific IgM is available but may give falsepositive results unless steps are taken to remove rheumatoid factor or most of the IgG antibody before the serum sample is tested Because CMVspecific IgM may be produced in low levels in reactivated CMV infection its presence is not always indicative of primary infection Only virus recovered from a target organ such as the lung provides unequivocal evidence that the current illness is caused by acquired CMV infection If serologic tests detect a positive or high titer of IgG this result should not automatically be interpreted to mean that active CMV infection is present Active CMV infection is considered to be present if antibody tests of paired serum samples show a fourfold rise in IgG antibody and a significant level of IgM antibody equal to at least  of the IgG value or if virus is cultured from a urine or throat specimencitation needed
Although the risks discussed above are generally low CMV assays are part of the standard screening for nondirected blood donation donations not specified for a particular person in the US the UK and many other countries  CMVnegative donations are then earmarked for transfusion to infants or people who are immunocompromised Some blood donation centers maintain lists of donors whose blood is CMV negative due to special demands
During allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant it is generally advised to match the serostatus of donor and recipient If the recipient is seronegative a seropositive donor carries a risk of de novo infection Conversely a seropositive recipient is at risk of viral reactivation if they receive a transplant from a seronegative donor losing their innate defenses in the process In general the risk is highest for CMV seropositive recipients in which viral reactivation is a cause of significant morbidity For these reasons CMV serologic testing is routine for both bone marrow donors and recipients
A phase  study of a CMVvaccine published in  indicated an efficacy of the protection provided was limited and a number of subjects contracted CMV infection despite vaccination In one case also congenital CMV was encountered
In  Astellas Pharma started on individuals who received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant a phase  trial with its CMV deoxyribonucleic acid DNA cytomegalovirus vaccine ASP
In  Astellas Pharma commenced on healthy volunteers a phase  trial with its cytomegalovirus vaccine ASP
Further cytomegalovirus vaccines candidates are the CMVMVA Triplex vaccine and the CMVppA peptide vaccine Both vaccine candidates are sponsored by the City of Hope National Medical Center As of  the development is in clinical phase  trial stage
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC recommend regular hand washing especially after changing diapers Hand washing is also recommended after feeding a child wiping a childs nose or mouth or handling childrens toys
Hyperimmune globulin enriched for CMV CMVIGIV is an immunoglobulin G IgG containing a standardized number of antibodies to cytomegalovirus It may be used for the prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus disease associated with transplantation of kidney lung liver pancreas and heart Alone or in combination with an antiviral agent it has been shown to
Ganciclovir Cytovene treatment is used for people with depressed immunity who have either sightrelated or lifethreatening illnesses Valganciclovir Valcyte is an antiviral drug that is also effective and is given orally it is a prodrug that gets converted into ganciclovir in the body but is much better absorbed orally than the latter The therapeutic effectiveness is frequently compromised by the emergence of drugresistant virus isolates A variety of amino acid changes in the UL protein kinase and the viral DNA polymerase have been reported to cause drug resistance Foscarnet or cidofovir are only given to people with CMV resistant to ganciclovir because foscarnet has notable nephrotoxicity resulting in increased or decreased Ca or PO− and decreased Mg levelscitation needed
Letermovir has been approved by the European Medicines Agency and the FDA for treatment and prophylaxis of HCMV infection
All three currently licensed antiHCMV drugs target the viral DNA polymerase pUL Ganciclovir GCV acts as nucleoside analogue Its antiviral activity requires phosphorylation by the HCMV protein kinase pUL The second drug Cidofovir CDV is a nucleotide analogue which is already phosphorylated and thus active Finally Foscarnet FOS has a different mode of action It directly inhibits polymerase function by blocking the pyrophosphate binding site of pUL note investigational drug letermovir acts through a mechanism that involves viral terminase
Two HCMV proteins are implicated in antiviral resistance against these three drugs pUL and pUL Specific mutations in pUL can cause reduced phosphorylation activity of this viral protein kinase Thus fewer monophosphorylated – and thus active – GCV can be synthesized leading to antiviral resistance against GCV About  of all GCV resistances are caused by such mutations in UL Mutations in pUL may have different effects leading to antiviral drug resistance A They can lead to decreased affinity to antiviral compounds This resistance mechanism concerns GCV CDV and FOS and may lead to multidrug resistance B Some mutations in pUL can increase the polymerases exonuclease activity This causes enhanced recognition of incorporated GCV and CDV As a result these dNTP analogues are excised more efficiently
Major risk factors for HCMV drug resistance are the residual capacity of the hosts immune system to control viral replication and the overall amount and duration of viral replication
HCMV antiviral drug resistance can be detected by phenotypic or by genotypic drug resistance testing Phenotypic resistance testing involves cultivation of the virus in cell culture and testing its susceptibility using different antiviral drug concentrations in order to determine EC values In contrast genotypic resistance testing means the detection of resistance associated mutations in UL and UL by sequencing Genotypic resistance testing is becoming the method of choice because it is faster but requires previous phenotypic characterisation of each newly found mutation This can be performed via a webbased search tool that links a persons HCMV sequence to a database containing all published UL and UL mutations and corresponding antiviral drug susceptibility phenotypes
In the United States CMV infection rises with age from about  of people infected by  years of age leveling off at about – of the population by ages –
