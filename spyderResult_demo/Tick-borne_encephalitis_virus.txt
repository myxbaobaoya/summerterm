Tickborne encephalitis virus TBEV is a positivestrand RNA virus associated with tickborne encephalitis in the genus Flavivirus 
TBEV is a member of the genus Flavivirus Other close relatives members of the TBEV serocomplex include Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus Kyasanur Forest disease virus Alkhurma virus Louping ill virus and Langat virus
TBEV has three subtypes
The reference strain is the Sofjin strain
TBEV is a positivesense singlestranded RNA virus contained in a  nm spherical enveloped capsid The TBEV genome is approximately kb in size which contains a  cap a single open reading frame with  and  UTRs and is without polyadenylation Like other flaviviruses the TBEV genome codes for ten viral proteins three structural and seven nonstructural NS 
The structural proteins are C capsid PrM premembrane which is cleaved to produce the final membrane protein M and E envelope The seven nonstructural proteins are NS NSA NSB NS NSA NSB and NS The role of some nonstructural proteins is known NS serves as RNAdependent RNA polymerase NS has protease in complex with NSB and helicase activity Structural and nonstructural proteins are not required for the genome to be infectious All viral proteins are expressed as a single large polyprotein with the order C PrM E NS NSA NSB NS NSA NSB NS
Infection of the vector begins when a tick takes a blood meal from an infected host This can occur at any part of the ticks life cycle but a horizontal transmission between infected nymphs and uninfected larvae cofeeding on the same host is thought to be key in maintaining the circulation of TBEV TBEV in the blood of the host infects the tick through the midgut from where it can pass to the salivary glands to be passed to the next host In nonadult ticks TBEV is transmitted transtadially by infecting cells that are not destroyed during molting thus the tick remains infectious throughout its life Infected adult ticks may be able to lay eggs that are infected transmitting the virus transorvarially
In humans the infection begins in the skin with the exception of foodborne cases about  of infections at the site of the bite of an infected tick where Langerhans cells and macrophages in the skin are preferentially targeted TBEV envelope E proteins recognize heparan sulfate and likely other receptors on the host cell surface and are endocytosed via the clathrin mediated pathway Acidification of the late endosome triggers a conformational change in the E proteins resulting in fusion followed by uncoating and release of the singlestranded RNA genome into the cytoplasm 
The viral polyprotein is translated and inserts into the ER membrane where it is processed on the cytosolic side by host peptidases and in the lumen by viral enzyme action The viral proteins C NS and NS are cleaved into the cytosol though NS can complex with NSB or NSA to perform proteolytic or helicase activity while the remaining nonstructural proteins alter the structure of the ER membrane This altered membrane permits the assembly of replication complexes where the viral genome is replicated by the viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase NS 
Newly replicated viral RNA genomes are then packaged by the C proteins while on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane forming the immature nucleocapsid and gain E and PrM proteins arranged as a heterodimer during budding into the lumen of the ER The immature virion is spiky and geometric in comparison to the mature particle The particle passes through the golgi apparatus and transgolgi network under increasingly acidic conditions by which the virion matures with cleavage of the Pr segment from the M protein and formation fusion competent E protein homodimers Though the cleaved Pr segment remains associated with protein complex until exit  
The virus is released from the host cell upon fusion of the transport vesicle with the host cell membrane the cleaved Pr now segments dissociate resulting in a fully mature infectious virus However partially mature and immature viruses are sometimes released as well immature viruses are noninfectious as the E proteins are not fusion competent partially mature viruses are still capable of infection
With the exception of foodborne cases infection begins in the skin at the site of the tick bite Skin dendritic or Langerhans cells DCs are preferentially targeted Initially the virus replicates locally and immune response is triggered when viral components are recognized by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors PRRs such as Tolllike receptors TLRs Recognition causes the release of cytokines including interferons IFN α β  and γ and chemokines attracting migratory immune cells to the site of the bite The infection may be halted at this stage and cleared before the onset of noticeable symptoms Notably tick saliva enhances infection by modulating host immune response dampening apoptotic signals If the infection continues migratory DCs and macrophages become infected and travel to the local draining lymph node where activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes monocytes and the complement system are activated
The draining lymph node can also serve as a viral amplification site from where TBEV gains systemic access This viremic stage corresponds to the first symptomatic phase in the prototypical biphasic pattern of tickborne encephalitis TBEV has a strong preference for neuronal tissue and is neuroinvasive The initial viremic stage allows access to a number of the preferential tissues However the exact mechanism by which TBEV crosses into the central nervous system CNS is unclear There are several proposed mechanism for TBEV breaching the bloodbrain barrier BBB The "Trojan Horse" mechanism whereby TBEV gains access to the CNS while infecting an immune cell that passes through the BBB  Disruption and increased permeability of the BBB by immune immune cytokines  Via infection of the olfactory neurons  Via retrograde transport along peripheral nerves to the CNS  Infection of the cells that make up part of the BBB
CNS infection brings on the second phase in the classic biphasic infection pattern associated with the European subtype CNS disease is immunopathological release of inflammatory cytokines coupled with the action of cytotoxic CD T cells and possibly NK cells results in inflammation and apoptosis of infected cells that is responsible for many of the CNS symptoms
TBEV specific IgM and IgG antibodies are produced in response to infection IgM antibodies appear and peak first as well as reaching higher levels and typically dissipate in about  months post infection though there exists considerable variation from patient to patient IgG levels peak at about  weeks after the appearance of CNS symptoms then decline slightly but do not dissipate likely conferring life long immunity to the patient
The ancestor of the extant strains appears to have separated into several clades approximately  years ago The Siberian and Far Eastern subtypes diverged about  years ago A second analysis suggests an earlier date of evolution  years ago with a rapid increase in the number of strains starting around  years ago Different strains of the virus have been transmitted at least three times into Japan between – years ago The strains circulating in Latvia appear to have originated from both Russia and Western Europe while those in Estonia appear to have originated in Russia The Lithuanian strains appear to be related to those from Western Europe Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the European and Siberian TBEV subtypes are closely related while the Fareastern subtype is closer to the Louping Ill Virus However in antigenic relatedness based on the E NS and NS proteins all three subtypes are highly similar and Louping Ill virus is the closest relative outside the collective TBEV group
Though the first description of what may have been TBE appears in records in the s in Scandinavia identification of the TBEV virus occurred in the Soviet Union in the s The investigation began due to an outbreak of what was believed to be Japanese Encephalitis "Summer encephalitis" among Soviet troops stationed along the border with the Japanese empire present day Peoples Republic of China near the Far Eastern city of Khabarovsk The expedition was led by virologist Lev A Zilber who assembled a team of twenty young scientists in a number of related fields such as acarology microbiology neurology and epidemiology The expedition arrived in Khabarovsk on May   and divided into squads Northernled by Elizabeth N Levkovich and working in the Khabarovski Krai and Southernled by Alexandra D Sheboldaeva working in the Primorski Krai 
Inside the month of May the expedition had identified ticks as the likely vector collected I persucatus ticks by exposure of bare skin by entomologist Alexander V Gutsevich and virologist Mikhail P Chumakov had isolated the virus from ticks feeding on intentionally infected mice During the summer five expeditions members became infected with TBEV and while there were no fatalities three of the five suffered damaging sequelae 
The expedition returned in midAugust and in October of  Zilber and Sheboldova were arrested falsely accused of spreading Japanese encephalitis Expedition epidemiologist Tamara M Safonov was arrested the following January for protesting the charges against Zilber and Sheboldova As a consequence of the arrests one of the important initial works was published under the authorship of expedition acarologist Vasily S Mironov Zilber was released in  and managed to restore along with Sheboldova coauthorship on this initial work however Safanov and Sheboldova who was not released spent  years in labor camps
