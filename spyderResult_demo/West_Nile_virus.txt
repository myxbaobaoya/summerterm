West Nile virus WNV is a singlestranded RNA virus that causes West Nile fever It is a member of the family Flaviviridae from the genus Flavivirus which also contains the Zika virus dengue virus and yellow fever virus The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes mostly species of Culex The primary hosts of WNV are birds so that the virus remains within a "bird–mosquito–bird" transmission cycle The virus is genetically related to the Japanese encephalitis family of viruses
Humans and horses both exhibit disease symptoms from the virus and symptoms rarely occur in other animals Identification of the human disease was first made in  in Uganda and in the latter half of the th century spread to many other parts of the world
Like most other flaviviruses WNV is an enveloped virus with icosahedral symmetry  Electron microscope studies reveal a – nm virion covered with a relatively smooth protein shell this structure is similar to the dengue fever virus another Flavivirus The protein shell is made of two structural proteins the glycoprotein E and the small membrane protein M Protein E has numerous functions including receptor binding viral attachment and entry into the cell through membrane fusion
The outer protein shell is covered by a hostderived lipid membrane the viral envelope The flavivirus lipid membrane has been found to contain cholesterol and phosphatidylserine but other elements of the membrane have yet to be identified The lipid membrane has many roles in viral infection including acting as signaling molecules and enhancing entry into the cell Cholesterol in particular plays an integral part in WNV entering a host cell The two viral envelope proteins E and M are inserted into the membrane
The RNA genome is bound to capsid C proteins which are  aminoacid residues long to form the nucleocapsid The capsid proteins are one of the first proteins created in an infected cell the capsid protein is a structural protein whose main purpose is to package RNA into the developing viruses The capsid has been found to prevent apoptosis by affecting the Akt pathway
WNV is a positivesense singlestranded RNA virus Its genome is approximately  nucleotides long and is flanked by ′ and ′ noncoding stem loop structures The coding region of the genome codes for three structural proteins and seven nonstructural NS proteins proteins that are not incorporated into the structure of new viruses The WNV genome is first translated into a polyprotein and later cleaved by virus and host proteases into separate proteins ie NS C E
Structural proteins C prMM E are capsid precursor membrane proteins and envelope proteins respectively The structural proteins are located at the ′ end of the genome and are cleaved into mature proteins by both host and viral proteases
Nonstructural proteins consist of NS NSA NSB NS NSA NSB and NS These proteins mainly assist with viral replication or act as proteases The nonstructural proteins are located near the ′ end of the genome
Once WNV has successfully entered the bloodstream of a host animal the envelope protein E binds to attachment factors called glycosaminoglycans on the host cell These attachment factors aid entry into the cell however binding to primary receptors is also necessary Primary receptors include DCSIGN DCSIGNR and the integrin αvβ By binding to these primary receptors WNV enters the cell through clathrinmediated endocytosis As a result of endocytosis WNV enters the cell within an endosome
The acidity of the endosome catalyzes the fusion of the endosomal and viral membranes allowing the genome to be released into the cytoplasm Translation of the positivesense singlestranded RNA occurs at the endoplasmic reticulum the RNA is translated into a polyprotein which is then cleaved by both host and viral proteases NSBNS to produce mature proteins
In order to replicate its genome NS a RNA polymerase forms a replication complex with other nonstructural proteins to produce an intermediary negativesense singlestranded RNA the negativesense strand serves as a template for synthesis of the final positivesense RNA Once the positivesense RNA has been synthesized the capsid protein C encloses the RNA strands into immature virions The rest of the virus is assembled along the endoplasmic reticulum and through the Golgi apparatus and results in noninfectious immature virions The E protein is then glycosylated and prM is cleaved by furin a host cell protease into the M protein thereby producing an infectious mature virion The mature viruses are then secreted out of the cell
WNV is one of the Japanese encephalitis antigenic serocomplex of viruses together with Japanese encephalitis virus Murray Valley encephalitis virus Saint Louis encephalitis virus and some other flaviviruses Studies of phylogenetic lineages have determined that WNV emerged as a distinct virus around  years ago This initial virus developed into two distinct lineages Lineage  and its multiple profiles is the source of the epidemic transmission in Africa and throughout the world Lineage  was considered an African zoonosis However in  lineage  previously only seen in horses in subSaharan Africa and Madagascar began to appear in horses in Europe where the first known outbreak affected  animals in Hungary Lineage  West Nile virus was detected in South Africa in  in a mare and her aborted fetus previously only lineage  West Nile virus had been detected in horses and humans in South Africa Kunjin virus is a subtype of West Nile virus endemic to Oceania A  fatal case in a killer whale in Texas broadened the known host range of West Nile virus to include cetaceans
Since the first North American cases in  the virus has been reported throughout the United States Canada Mexico the Caribbean and Central America There have been human cases and equine cases and many birds are infected The Barbary macaque Macaca sylvanus was the first nonhuman primate to contract WNV Both the American and Israeli strains are marked by high mortality rates in infected avian populations the presence of dead birdsespecially Corvidaecan be an early indicator of the arrival of the virus
The natural hosts for WNV are birds and mosquitoes Over  different species of bird have been shown to be infected with the virus  Some birds including the American crow Corvus brachyrhynchos blue jay Cyanocitta cristata and greater sagegrouse Centrocercus urophasianus are killed by the infection but others survive The American robin Turdus migratorius and house sparrow Passer domesticus are thought to be among the most important reservoir species in N American and European cities Brown thrashers Toxostoma rufum gray catbirds Dumetella carolinensis northern cardinals Cardinalis cardinalis northern mockingbirds Mimus polyglottos wood thrushes Hylocichla mustelina and the dove family are among the other common N American birds in which high levels of antibodies against WNV have been found
WNV has been demonstrated in a large number of mosquito species but the most significant for viral transmission are Culex species that feed on birds including Culex pipiens C restuans C salinarius C quinquefasciatus C nigripalpus C erraticus and C tarsalis Experimental infection has also been demonstrated with soft tick vectors but is unlikely to be important in natural transmission
WNV has a broad host range and is also known to be able to infect at least  mammalian species including humans some nonhuman primates horses dogs and cats Some infected humans and horses experience disease but dogs and cats rarely show symptoms Reptiles and amphibians can also be infected including some species of crocodiles alligators snakes lizards and frogs Mammals are considered incidental or deadend hosts for the virus they do not usually develop a high enough level of virus in the blood viremia to infect another mosquito feeding on them and carry on the transmission cycle some birds are also deadend hosts
In the normal rural or enzootic transmission cycle the virus alternates between the bird reservoir and the mosquito vector It can also be transmitted between birds via direct contact by eating an infected bird carcass or by drinking infected water Vertical transmission between female and offspring is possible in mosquitoes and might potentially be important in overwintering In the urban or spillover cycle infected mosquitoes that have fed on infected birds transmit the virus to humans This requires mosquito species that bite both birds and humans which are termed bridge vectors The virus can also rarely be spread through blood transfusions organ transplants or from mother to baby during pregnancy delivery or breastfeeding Unlike in birds it does not otherwise spread directly between people
West Nile fever is an infection by the West Nile virus which is typically spread by mosquitoes In about  of infections people have few or no symptoms About  of people develop a fever headache vomiting or a rash In less than  of people encephalitis or meningitis occurs with associated neck stiffness confusion or seizures Recovery may take weeks to months The risk of death among those in whom the nervous system is affected is about  percent
West Nile virus WNV is usually spread by mosquitoes that become infected when they feed on infected birds which often carry the disease Rarely the virus is spread through blood transfusions organ transplants or from mother to baby during pregnancy delivery or breastfeeding but it otherwise does not spread directly between people Risks for severe disease include being over  years old and having other health problems Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and blood tests
There is no human vaccine The best way to reduce the risk of infection is to avoid mosquito bites Mosquito populations may be reduced by eliminating standing pools of water such as in old tires buckets gutters and swimming pools When mosquitoes cannot be avoided mosquito repellent window screens and mosquito nets reduce the likelihood of being bitten There is no specific treatment for the disease pain medications may reduce symptoms
Severe disease may also occur in horses Several vaccines for these animals are now available Before the availability of veterinary vaccines around  of horses infected in North America died
According to the Center for Disease Control infection with West Nile Virus is seasonal in temperate zones Climates that are temperate such as those in the United States and Europe see peak season from July to October Peak season changes depending on geographic region and warmer and humid climates can see longer peak seasons All ages are equally likely to be infected but there is a higher amount of death and neuroinvasive West Nile Virus in people – years old People of older age are more likely to have adverse effects
There are several modes of transmission but the most common cause of infection in humans is by being bitten by an infected mosquito Other modes of transmission include blood transfusion organ transplantation breastfeeding transplacental transmission and laboratory acquisition These alternative modes of transmission are extremely rare
Prevention efforts against WNV mainly focus on preventing human contact with and being bitten by infected mosquitoes This is twofold first by personal protective actions and second by mosquitocontrol actions When a person is in an area that has WNV it is important to avoid outdoor activity and if they go outside they should use a mosquito repellent with DEET A person can also wear clothing that covers more skin such as long sleeves and pants Mosquito control can be done at the community level and include surveillance programs and control programs including pesticides and reducing mosquito habitats This includes draining standing water Surveillance systems in birds is particularly useful If dead birds are found in a neighborhood the event should be reported to local authorities This may help health departments do surveillance and determine if the birds are infected with West Nile Virus
Despite the commercial availability of four veterinary vaccines for horses no human vaccine has progressed beyond phase II clinical trials Efforts have been made to produce a vaccine for human use and several candidates have been produced but none are licensed to use The best method to reduce the risk of infections is avoiding mosquito bites This may be done by eliminating standing pools of water such as in old tires buckets gutters and swimming pools Mosquito repellent window screens mosquito nets and avoiding areas where mosquitoes occur may also be useful
Like other tropical diseases which are expected to have increased spread due to climate change there is concern that changing weather conditions will increase West Nile Virus spread Climate change will affect disease rates ranges seasonality and affects the distribution of West Nile Virus
Projected changes in flood frequency and severity can bring new challenges in flood risk management allowing for increased mosquito populations in urban areas Weather conditions affected by climate change including temperature precipitation and wind may affect the survival and reproduction rates of mosquitoes suitable habitats distribution and abundance Ambient temperatures drive mosquito replication rates and transmission of WNV by affecting the peak season of mosquitoes and geographic variations For example increased temperatures can affect the rate of virus replication speed up the virus evolution rate and viral transmission efficiency Furthermore higher winter temperatures and warmer spring may lead to larger summer mosquito populations increasing the risk for WNV Similarly rainfall may also drive mosquito replication rates and affect the seasonality and geographic variations of the virus Studies show an association between heavy precipitation and higher incidence of reported WNV Likewise wind is another environmental factor that serves as a dispersal mechanism for mosquitoes
Mosquitoes have extremely wide environmental tolerances and a nearly ubiquitous geographical distribution being present on all major land masses except Antarctica and Iceland Nevertheless changes in climate and land use on ecological timescales can variously expand or fragment their distribution patterns raising consequent concerns for human health
