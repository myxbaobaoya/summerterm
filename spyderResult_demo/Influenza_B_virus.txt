Influenza B virus is the only species in the genus Betainfluenzavirus in the virus family Orthomyxoviridae
Influenza B virus is known only to infect humans and seals This limited host range is apparently responsible for the lack of associated influenza pandemics in contrast with those caused by the morphologically similar influenza A virus  as both mutate by both antigenic drift and reassortment There are two known circulating lineages of Influenza B virus based on the antigenic properties of the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin The lineages are termed BYamagatalike and BVictorialike viruses The quadrivalent influenza vaccine licensed by the CDC is currently designed to protect against both cocirculating lineages and has been shown to have greater effectiveness in prevention of influenza caused by Influenza B virus than the previous trivalent vaccine
Further diminishing the impact of this virus "in humans influenza B viruses evolve slower than A viruses and faster than C viruses" Influenzavirus B mutates at a rate  to  times slower than type A Nevertheless it is accepted that Influenza B virus could cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide and significantly impacts adolescents and schoolchildren
The BYamagata lineage might have become extinct in  due to COVID pandemic measures
The Influenza B virus capsid is enveloped while its virion consists of an envelope a matrix protein a nucleoprotein complex a nucleocapsid and a polymerase complex It is sometimes spherical and sometimes filamentous Its  or so surface projections are made of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase
The Influenza B virus genome is  nucleotides long and consists of eight segments of linear negativesense singlestranded RNA The multipartite genome is encapsidated each segment in a separate nucleocapsid and the nucleocapsids are surrounded by one envelope
The subtypes of influenza A virus are estimated to have diverged  years ago Influenza viruses A and B are estimated to have diverged from a single ancestor around  years ago while the ancestor of influenza viruses A and B and the ancestor of influenza virus C are estimated to have diverged from a common ancestor around  years ago Metatranscriptomics studies have also identified closely related "Influenza Blike" viruses such as the Wuhan spiny eel influenza virus and also "InfluenzaB like" viruses in a number of vertebrate species such as salamanders and fish
