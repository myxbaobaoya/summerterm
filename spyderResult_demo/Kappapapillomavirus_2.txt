The Shope papilloma virus  SPV also known as cottontail rabbit papilloma virus CRPV or Kappapapillomavirus  is a papillomavirus which infects certain leporids causing keratinous carcinomas resembling horns typically on or near the animals head The carcinomas can metastasize or become large enough to interfere with the hosts ability to eat causing starvation Richard E Shope investigated the horns and discovered the virus in  an important breakthrough in the study of oncoviruses The virus was originally discovered in cottontail rabbits  in the Midwestern US but can also infect brush rabbits blacktailed jackrabbits  snowshoe hares and European rabbits
In the s hunters in northwestern Iowa reported that the rabbits they shot had several "horn" protrusions on many parts of their bodies including their faces and necks The virus is also a possible source of myths about the jackalope a rabbit with the horns of an antelope and related cryptids such as the wolpertinger Stories and illustrations of horned rabbits appear in scientific treatises dating back many years such as the Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique from 
The Iowa reports led cancer researcher Richard E Shope to investigate and he discovered the virus in  He separated the virus from horny warts on cottontail rabbits and made one of the first mammalian tumor virus discoveries Shope determined the  protrusions were keratinous carcinomas due to the infection of CRPV Shopes research led to the development of the first mammalian model of a cancer caused by a virus He was able to isolate virus particles from tumors on captured animals and use these to inoculate domestic rabbits which then developed similar tumors This has contributed to our understanding of fundamental mechanisms in neoplasia or the formation of a new abnormal growth of tissue The virus was sequenced in  showing substantial sequence similarities to HPVa It has been used as a model for human papillomaviruses both before and after this discovery The most visible example of this role is the HPV vaccine which was developed based on and incorporating research done using the virus as a model Similarly it has been used to investigate antiviral therapies
There is a lack of specific data about the reproductive cycle of papillomaviruses Research is not conclusive about which coding regions are expressed before or after replication of viral DNA The E region should carried the DNA required for cis andor trans E is the largest Open reading frame which is the set of codons in the genome that code for proteins encoding a  base protein  E is similar to COOHterminal domain of the Simian virus  plays a role in viral DNA replication maintaining plasmids within a cell Results have found that CRPV and BPV are found in the same location of the genome which indicates that papillomaviruses likely have similar methods of replicating their genomes outside of a chromosome A notable difference between the genomes of the four strains is that the E protein is almost twice as long in the CRPV as in any of the other strains of papillomaviruses The E protein is somewhat homologous with a family of ATP syntheses that are found in mitochondria of cattle The homology is significant enough to imply an evolutionary relationship between E and the beta chain of the ATP synthase family however they do not have the same function or enzyme activity The E protein overlaps with the E open reading frames in the other papillomaviruses These differences in the E proteins likely determine how oncogenic a virus is The noncoding region has a homologies with BPV Other homologies exist such as the fact that all papillomaviruses have repeated sequences in the noncoding parts of their genomes CRPV has some notable repeats some as long as  base pairs Many pairs up stream of the transcription locations are homologous with promoter sequences in of SV
The papillomavirus life cycle begins with cells actively multiplying in epithelial cells of basal and parabasal layers The differentiation of these cells is necessary for this virus to complete its life cycle Transforming proteins E and E induce the Sphase in the lower epithelial layers Viral replication proteins E and E are also required to form the papilloma and keep the episomal viral genome replication low Genome amplification will be restrained until viral replication proteins increase and several viral proteins are coexpressed The infected differentiating cells travel towards the epithelial surface during the viral cycles late stage In the upper epithelial layers the promoter activity is altered during the virus production E proteins are expressed and viral DNA amplification starts in the differentiated cells Following this the L and L viral capsid proteins are expressed and the infectious virions begin to assemble
Expression of the papillomavirus E protein correlates with the onset of viral DNA amplification Using a mutant cottontail rabbit papillomavirus SPV genome incapable of expressing the viral E protein it has been shown that E is required for the productive stage of the SPV life cycle in New Zealand White and cottontail rabbits
The virus particles are assembled in the upper epithelium The virus capsomere icosahedral shell is packaged with an  base pair genome  L protein copies and  copies of L proteins inside L proteins gather at PML body nuclear structures and recruit L proteins during virus assemblage L proteins are not necessary for assemblage but it is possible that they augment packaging and infectivity Capsid proteins have been thought to also gather at the PML bodies during packaging
Transmittance of the Papillomavirus requires release from the infected skin cell at the epithelial surface as they are nonlytic They are resistant to desiccation enhancing their survivability during extracellular transfer between hosts Cornified squame release from the surface of epithelial cells may also contribute to their survival Immune detection of the virus in the host may also be hindered by antigen retention until the virus reaches upper epithelial cells
When Richard E Shope began his research on SPV little was known about the natural transmission of the virus vectors and interactions of the virus on its hosts In the lab setting Shope worked with the virus natural host the cottontail rabbit Particularly he worked with the cottontails of Iowa and other western states of the United States He worked with these species because it was discovered that SPV had a restricted geographic range and was confined to the high plains of the western United States Therefore the major host species of SPV is the cottontail rabbit of the western United States Cottontail rabbits in Shopes lab usually were infected with the virus through parasites such as rabbit ticks When infected with SPV hosts develop papillomas on hairbearing skin usually around the face and neck Shope found through his research that rabbit epidermal cell transformation by SPV requires interaction with mesenchymal cells It was further found that mesenchymal types support papillomatous transformation Shopes research also investigated how vitamin A deficiencies or excess might affect host susceptibility to SPV Shope found that deficiencies in vitamin A did not affect the relative growth of the papillomas but in cases where there was excesses of vitamin A Shope papillomas were inhibited Therefore when SPV infects a host vitamin A plays an important role in the hostvirus interactions
Fluorescent antibody study identified the locations of viral antigens in wild rabbit papillomas They were present only in the nucleus of keratohyaline and keratinized layer cells and not deeper down in proliferating epithelial cells In domesticated rabbits the viral antigens were present in much smaller quantity in only superficial keratinized layers The investigation proposed that the virus is only present in proliferating cell nuclei during early development containing a deficient amount of proteins and mostly nucleic acid The proteins may be immunologically specific in order to keep its transmissibility making it a masked virus
Most homologous papillomaviruses are actually CRPV and HPVa This is possibly because both of these viruses target the skin From an evolutionary perspective CRPV and HPVa could have diverged recently or they could have converged due to their similar target CRPV is a member of the papillomaviruses so it is related to all viruses in this family
Infection of a rabbits follicular cell often occurs in locations including ears nose eyelids and the anus The infection first appears as a red and swollen area on the skin followed by development of circular papilloma warts and keratinized horny warts Although transmission between rabbits is high the tumors themselves do not contain the infectious virus  of Papilloma infections become malignant and form squamous cell carcinoma Metastases can form in the lungs and lymph nodes and if it advances further can develop in the kidneys and the liver
Rabbit Papilloma displays tropism for the cutaneous epithelium Warts are made up of nearly homogenous vertical tissue strands Their outer coloration is typically black or greyish and cut sections are usually white or pinkish white with a fleshlike center Dark coloration is due to abundant melanin pigment The warts are made up of several tight branching threadlike epidermis processes connected by narrow tissue cores These growth structures indicate that the growth occurs simultaneously at several different centers causing the surrounding tissue to bulge from the growths lateral pressure The normal epithelium abruptly transitions into a narrow zone of rapidly thickening epithelial layers made up of rapidly multiplying cells
Rabbits reinfected with the virus exhibit some or complete immunity and can transmit the virus to other wild rabbits and from wild to domestic rabbits A domestic strain cannot transmit it to another domestic rabbit however
Immunologically the papillomatosis virus is not related to fibroma or myxoma in rabbits
