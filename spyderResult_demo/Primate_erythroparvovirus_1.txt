Primate erythroparvovirus  generally referred to as B virus BV parvovirus B or sometimes erythrovirus B is the first and until  the only known human virus in the family Parvoviridae genus Erythroparvovirus it measures only – nm in diameter The name is derived from Latin parvum meaning small reflecting the fact that B ranks among the smallest DNA viruses B virus is most known for causing disease in the pediatric population however it can also affect adults It is the classic cause of the childhood rash called fifth disease or erythema infectiosum or "slapped cheek syndrome"
The virus was discovered by chance in  by Australian virologist Yvonne Cossart It gained the B name because it was discovered in well B of a large series of microtiter plates
Erythroviruses belong to the Parvoviridae family of small DNA viruses Human parvovirus B is a nonenveloped icosahedral virus that contains a singlestranded linear DNA genome of approximately  base pairs in length The infectious particles may contain either positive or negative strands of DNA The icosahedral capsid consists of  capsomeres consisting of two structural proteins VP  kDa and VP  kDa which are identical except for  amino acids at the aminoterminal of the VPprotein the socalled VPunique region VP is the major capsid protein and comprises approximately  of the total virus particle VPproteins are incorporated into the capsid structure in a nonstoichiometrical relation based on antibodybinding analysis and Xray structural analysis the VPunique region is assumed to be exposed at the surface of the virus particle At each end of the DNA molecule there are palindromic sequences which form "hairpin" loops The hairpin at the  end serves as a primer for the DNA polymerase It is classified as an erythrovirus because of its capability to invade red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow Three genotypes with subtypes have been recognised
The genome of human parvovirus B encodes four other proteins in addition to VP and VP The most notable of which is the large nonstructural protein commonly referred to as NS NS sequencespecifically binds and cleaves DNA via restriction endonuclease activity at its Nterminus NS is responsible for the regulation of certain cellular promoters including the pWAF promoter and is thought to regulate the virus own promoter The  kDa protein encoded by the viral genome has been implicated in viral DNA replication
The nucleotide substitution rate for total coding DNA has been estimated to be   x − substitutionssiteyear This rate is similar to that of other singlestranded DNA viruses VP codons were found to be under purifying selection In contrast VP codons in the unique part of the gene were found to be under diversifying selection This diversifying selection is consistent with persistent infection as this part of the VP protein contains epitopes recognised by the immune systemcitation needed
Like other nonenveloped DNA viruses pathogenicity of parvovirus B involves binding to host cell receptors internalization translocation of the genome to the host nucleus DNA replication RNA transcription assembly of capsids and packaging of the genome and finally cell lysis with release of the mature virions In humans the P antigen also known as globoside is the cellular receptor for parvovirus B virus that causes erythema infectiosum fifth disease in children This infection is sometimes complicated by severe aplastic anemia caused by lysis of early erythroid precursorscitation needed
The most recent common ancestor of the extant strains has been dated to about  years ago Three genotypes  and   are recognised A recombination between types  and  gave rise to genotype  between  and  years agocitation needed
The virus is primarily spread by infected respiratory droplets bloodborne transmission however has been reported The secondary attack risk for exposed household persons is about  and about half of that for classroom contacts
Symptoms begin some six days after exposure between  and  days with the average being  to  days and last about a week Infected patients with normal immune systems are contagious before becoming symptomatic but probably not after Individuals with B IgG antibodies are generally considered immune to recurrent infection but reinfection is possible in a minority of cases About half of adults are Bimmune due to a past infection
A significant increase in the number of cases is seen every three to four years the last epidemic year was  Outbreaks can arise especially in nurseries and schools
Parvovirus B causes an infection in humans only Cat and dog parvoviruses do not infect humans There is no vaccine available for human parvovirus B though attempts have been made to develop one
Fifth disease or erythema infectiosum is only one of several expressions of parvovirus B The associated bright red rash of the cheeks gives it the nickname "slapped cheek syndrome" Any age may be affected although it is most common in children aged six to ten years It is so named because it was the fifth most common cause of a pinkred infection associated rash to be described by physicians many of the others such as measles and rubella are rare now
Once infected patients usually develop the illness after an incubation period of four to fourteen days The disease commences with high fever and malaise when the virus is most abundant in the bloodstream and patients are usually no longer infectious once the characteristic rash of this disease has appeared The following symptoms are characteristic
Teenagers or young adults may develop the socalled "Papular Purpuric Gloves and Socks Syndrome"
Parvovirus B is a cause of chronic anemia in individuals who have AIDS It is frequently overlooked Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin usually resolves the anemia although relapse can occur The parvovirus infection may trigger an inflammatory reaction in AIDS patients who have just begun antiretroviral therapy
Arthralgias and arthritis are commonly reported in association with parvovirus B infection in adults whereas erythema infectiosum is the main symptom observed in children The occurrence of arthralgia coincides with the initial detection of circulating IgM and IgGantibodies against the viral structural proteins VP and VP Parvovirus B infection may affect the development of arthritis In adults and perhaps some children parvovirus B can lead to a seronegative arthritis which is usually easily controlled with analgesics Women are approximately twice as likely as men to experience arthritis after parvovirus infection Possibly up to  of all new cases of arthritis are due to parvovirus and a history of recent contact with a patient and positive serology generally confirms the diagnosis This arthritis does not progress to other forms of arthritis Typically joint symptoms last – weeks but in – of those affected it may last weeks to months
A Danish study has links between B with polymyalgia rheumatica
Although most patients have a decrease of erythropoiesis production of red blood cells during parvovirus infection it is most dangerous in patients with preexisting bone marrow stress for example sickle cell anemia or hereditary spherocytosis and are therefore heavily dependent on erythropoiesis due to the reduced lifespan of the red cells This is termed "aplastic crisis" also called reticulocytopenia It is treated with blood transfusion
Parvovirus infection in pregnant women is associated with hydrops fetalis due to severe fetal anemia sometimes leading to miscarriage or stillbirth This is due to a combination of hemolysis of the red blood cells as well as the virus directly negatively affecting the red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow The risk of fetal loss is about  if infection occurs before pregnancy week  especially between weeks  and  but minimal after then Routine screening of the antenatal sample would enable the pregnant mother to determine the risk of infectioncitation needed Knowledge of her status would allow the mother to avoid contact with individuals suspected or known to have an ongoing infection however at the present time antenatal testing for immunity is not recommended since there is no good means to prevent the infection there is no specific therapy and there are no vaccines available It may increase maternal anxiety and fear without proven benefit The best approach would be to recommend all pregnant women to avoid contact with children with current symptoms of infection as described above The risk to the fetus will be reduced with correct diagnosis of the anemia by ultrasound scans and treatment by blood transfusions There is some evidence that intrauterine parvovirus B infection leads to developmental abnormalities in childhood
At the moment there are no treatments that directly target parvovirus B virus Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy IVIG therapy has been a popular alternative because doctors can administer it without stopping chemotherapy drugs like MELASCT Also the treatments side effects are rare as only  out of  patients had complications  had acute kidney injury and  had pulmonary edema even though  of the patients had organ transplants and  of them were HIV positive This is a large improvement over administering rituximabcitation needed The monoclonal antibody against the CD protein has been shown to cause acute hepatitis neutropenia via parvovirus B reactivations and even persistent parvovirus B infection However it is important to note that IVIG therapy is not perfect as  of treated patients will have a relapse after  months
As of  no approved human vaccine existed against parvovirus B
