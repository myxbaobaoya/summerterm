The following species are assigned to the genus
Viruses in Alphapapillomavirus are nonenveloped with icosahedral geometries and T symmetry The diameter is around Â nm Genomes are circular around kb in length
Viral replication is nuclear Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral proteins to host receptors which mediates endocytosis Replication follows the dsDNA bidirectional replication model DNA templated transcription with some alternative splicing mechanism is the method of transcription Translation takes place by leaky scanning and  ribosomal shunting The virus exits the host cell by nuclear envelope breakdown
Humans and  monkeys serve as the natural host Transmission routes are sexual and contact
