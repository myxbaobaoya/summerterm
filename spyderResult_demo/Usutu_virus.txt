Usutu virus USUV is a flavivirus belonging to the Japanese encephalitis complex which is an emerging zoonotic arbovirus of concern because of its pathogenicity to humans and its similarity in ecology with other emerging arboviruses such as West Nile virus It mainly infects Culex mosquitoes and birds humans form a deadend host First identified in South Africa in  the virus has caused outbreaks in birds across Europe since  Nearly  cases in humans have been reported as of  mainly in Europe These are predominantly asymptomatic but some people experience neurological symptoms
USUV was first identified by Bruce McIntosh in Culex neavei mosquitoes in South Africa in  and is named after the Usutu River The virus was later identified in Mansonia aurites mosquitoes in Uganda In  USUV was identified outside Africa for the first time causing significant mortality among Old World blackbirds in Italy
Only two human cases have been identified in Africa in  and  with one benign and one severe case described The first human case outside Africa was reported in Italy in  where an immunocompromised patient was infected causing encephalitis
USUV has a diameter of – nm and is enveloped The genome is a sense singlestranded RNA of  nucleotides with a ′ Nmethylguanosinetriphosphate cap There is one open reading frame which encodes a amino acid polyprotein This is processed to generate eleven proteins three structural and eight nonstructural proteins Replication occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell
The virus has eight lineages five in Europe and three in Africa
USUV has been reported from several African countries including Burkina Faso Central African Republic Cote dIvoire Morocco Nigeria Senegal South Africa Tunisia and Uganda as well as from Israel Since  it has also been found in European countries including Austria Belgium Croatia Czech Republic France Germany Greece Hungary Italy Serbia Spain and Switzerland and more recently the Netherlands and was spreading across Europe in the late s Outbreaks are often simultaneous with those of the related West Nile virus
USUVs host range includes primarily Culex mosquitoes and birds The main bird hosts are blackbirds Turdus merula magpies Pica pica and owls including the great grey owl Strix nebulosa In addition to humans the virus has been isolated from Pipistrellus bats and antiUSUV antibodies have been found in horses dogs deer wild boar rodents and shrews Humans and horses are deadend hosts The vector is one of several mosquitoes that bite birds in Europe particularly Culex pipiens For example a – survey of mosquitoes and birds in the EmiliaRomagna region of Italy detected USUV in  C pipiens pools and in  Aedes albopictus pools suggesting the possible involvement of A albopictus in the virus cycle The virus was also found in twelve wild birds primarily Eurasian magpies P pica hooded crows Corvus cornix and Eurasian jays Garrulus glandarius In Africa multiple Culex species are involved as well as several species of Aedes and other mosquitoes
Two cases of symptomatic infection in humans have been reported from Africa with fever and skin rash but no neurological symptoms In Europe  infections were detected up to  these were mainly asymptomatic but neurological symptoms including encephalitis and meningoencephalitis have been observed
The virus is highly pathogenic in birds causing central nervous system symptoms enlargement of the liver and spleen and infiltration by inflammatory cells in a wide range of organs
