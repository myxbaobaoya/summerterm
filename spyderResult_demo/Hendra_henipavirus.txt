Hendra virus scientific name Hendra henipavirus is a batborne virus that is associated with a highly fatal infection in horses and humans Numerous disease outbreaks in Australia among horses have been caused by Hendra virus The Hendra virus belongs to the genus Henipavirus which also contains the Nipah virus which has also caused disease outbreaks
Flying foxes experimentally infected with the Hendra virus develop a viraemia and shed the virus in their urine faeces and saliva for approximately one week There is no other indication of an illness in them Symptoms of Hendra virus infection of humans may be respiratory including hemorrhage and edema of the lungs or in some cases viral meningitis In horses infection usually causes one or more of pulmonary oedema congestion and neurological signs
Ephrin B has been identified as the main receptor for the henipaviruses
Flying foxes have been identified as the reservoir host of Hendra virus A seroprevalence of  is found in the flying foxes suggesting an endemic infection of the bat population throughout Australia Horses become infected with Hendra after exposure to bodily fluid from an infected flying fox This often happens in the form of urine feces or masticated fruit covered in the flying foxs saliva when horses are allowed to graze below roosting sites The seven human cases have all been infected only after contact with sick horses As a result veterinarians are particularly at risk for contracting the disease
Three main approaches are currently followed to reduce the risk to humans
Hendra virus originally called "Equine morbillivirus" was discovered in September  when it caused the deaths of thirteen horses and a trainer at a training complex at  Williams Avenue Hendra a suburb of Brisbane in Queensland Australia
The index case a mare called Drama Series brought in from a paddock in Cannon Hill was housed with  other horses after falling ill and died two days later Subsequently all of the horses became ill with  dying The remaining six animals were subsequently euthanised as a way of preventing relapsing infection and possible further transmission The trainer Victory Vic Rail and the stable foreman Ray Unwin were involved in nursing the index case and both fell ill with an influenzalike illness within one week of the first horses death The stable hand recovered but Rail died of respiratory and kidney failure The source of the virus was most likely frothy nasal discharge from the index case
A second outbreak occurred in August  chronologically preceding the first outbreak in Mackay  km north of Brisbane resulting in the deaths of two horses and their owner The owner assisted in necropsies of the horses and within three weeks was admitted to hospital suffering from meningitis He recovered but  months later developed neurologic signs and died This outbreak was diagnosed retrospectively by the presence of Hendra virus in the brain of the patient
As of June  a total of fifty outbreaks of Hendra virus have occurred in Australia all involving infection of horses As a result of these events eightythree horses have died or been euthanized A further four died or were euthanized as a result of possible Hendra infection
Case fatality rate in humans is  and in horses 
Four of these outbreaks have spread to humans as a result of direct contact with infected horses On  July  a dog living on the Mt Alford property was reported to have HeV antibodies the first time an animal other than a flying fox horse or human has tested positive outside an experimental situation
These events have all been on the east coast of Australia with the most northern event at Cairns Queensland and the event furthest south at Kempsey New South Wales Until the event at Chinchilla Queensland in July  all outbreak sites had been within the distribution of at least two of the four mainland flying foxes fruit bats Little red flying fox Pteropus scapulatus black flying fox Pteropus alecto greyheaded flying fox Pteropus poliocephalus and spectacled flying fox Pteropus conspicillatus Chinchilla is considered to be only within the range of little red flying fox and is west of the Great Dividing Range This is the furthest west the infection has ever been identified in horses
The timing of incidents indicates a seasonal pattern of outbreaks Initially this was thought to possibly be related to the breeding cycle of the little red flying foxes These species typically give birth between April and May Subsequently however the Spectacled flying fox and the Black flying fox have been identified as the species more likely to be involved in infection spillovers
Timing of outbreaks also appears more likely during the cooler months when it is possible the temperature and humidity are more favourable to the longer term survival of the virus in the environment
There is no evidence of transmission to humans directly from bats and as such it appears that human infection only occurs via an intermediate host a horse Despite this in  the NSW Government approved the destruction of flying fox colonies
In the years – fourteen events were recorded Between  June  and  August  a further seventeen events were identified during which twentyone horses died
It is not clear why there was a sudden increase in the number of spillover events between June and August  Typically HeV spillover events are more common between May and October This time is sometimes called "Hendra Season" which is a time when there are large numbers of fruit bats of all species congregated in SE Queenslands valuable winter foraging habitat The weather warm and humid is favourable to the survival of henipavirus in the environment
It is possible flooding in SE Queensland and Northern NSW in December  and January  may have affected the health of the fruit bats Urine sampling in flying fox camps indicate that a larger proportion of flying foxes than usual are shedding live virus Biosecurity Queenslands ongoing surveillance usually shows  of the animals are shedding live virus In June and July nearly  animals have been reported to be shedding live virus Present advice is that these events are not being driven by any mutation in HeV itself
Other suggestions include that an increase in testing has led to an increase in detection As the actual mode of transmission between bats and horses has not been determined it is not clear what if any factors can increase the chance of infection in horses
Following the confirmation of a dog with HeV antibodies on  July  the Queensland and NSW governments will boost research funding into the Hendra virus by  million to be spent by – This money will be used for research into ecological drivers of infection in the bats and the mechanism of virus transmission between bats and other species A further  million dollars was allocated by the federal government with the funds being split half for human health investigations and half for animal health and biodiversity research
