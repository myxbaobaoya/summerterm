Herpes simplex virus
Human alphaherpesvirus  HHV is a species of virus in the genus Simplexvirus subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae family Herpesviridae and order Herpesvirales
Human alphaherpesvirus  can be divided into two clades one is globally distributed and the other is mostly limited to sub Saharan Africa
Human alphaherpesvirus  infects humans most often as genital herpes In the United States more than one in six people have the virus It is primarily a sexually transmitted infection Human alphaherpesvirus  tends to reside in the sacral ganglia Human alphaherpesvirus  is periodically shed in the human genital tract most often asymptomatically Most sexual transmissions occur during periods of asymptomatic shedding Asymptomatic reactivation means that the virus causes atypical subtle or hardtonotice symptoms that are not identified as an active herpes infection so acquiring the virus is possible even if no active blisters or sores are present
In one study daily genital swab samples found Human alphaherpesvirus  at a median of â€“ of days among those who have had an outbreak and  of days among those suffering from asymptomatic infection with many of these episodes occurring without visible outbreak "subclinical shedding" In another study  subjects were randomized to receive valaciclovir  g daily or placebo for  days each in a twoway crossover design A daily swab of the genital area was selfcollected for Human alphaherpesvirus  detection by polymerase chain reaction to compare the effect of valaciclovir versus placebo on asymptomatic viral shedding in immunocompetent seropositive subjects without a history of symptomatic genital herpes infection The study found that valaciclovir significantly reduced shedding during subclinical days compared to placebo showing a  reduction  of subjects had no shedding while receiving valaciclovir versus  of subjects on placebo About  of patients treated with valaciclovir had no recognized signs or symptoms versus  for placebo For Human alphaherpesvirus  subclinical shedding may account for most of the transmission Studies on discordant partners one infected one not show that the transmission rate is approximately  per  sexual contacts Atypical symptoms are often attributed to other causes such as a yeast infection
