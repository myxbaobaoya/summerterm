Human alphaherpesvirus  HHV referred typically as varicellazoster virus VZV is one of nine known herpes viruses infecting humans It causes chickenpox varicella commonly affecting children and young adults and shingles herpes zoster in adults but rarely in children VZV infections are speciesspecific to humans but can survive in external environments for a few hours
VZV multiplies in the lungs and causes a wide variety of symptoms  After the primary infection chickenpox the virus lies dormant in the nerves including the cranial nerve ganglia dorsal root ganglia and autonomic ganglia  Many years after the person has recovered from chickenpox VZV can reactivate to cause neurological conditions
Primary varicella zoster virus infection results in chickenpox varicella which may result in complications including encephalitis pneumonia either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia or bronchitis either viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis Even when clinical symptoms of chickenpox have resolved VZV remains dormant in the nervous system of the infected person  virus latency in the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia VZV enters through the respiratory system Having an incubation period of – days averaging at  days Targeting the skin and peripheral nerve the period of illness is from  to  days – days before the rash appears is when this virus is the most contagious Signs and symptoms include vesicles that fill with pus rupture and scab before healing Lesions most commonly occur on the face throat the lower back the chest and shoulders
In about a third of cases VZV reactivates later in life producing a disease known as shingles or herpes zoster 
The individual lifetime risk of developing herpes zoster is thought to be between  and  or approximately  in  people However for individuals aged  and over this risk increases to  in  people
In a study from Sweden by Nilsson et al  the annual incidence of herpes zoster infection is estimated at a total of  cases per  inhabitants for all ages and  cases per  for people  years of age or older
VZV can also infect the central nervous system with a  article reporting an incidence rate of  cases per  inhabitants in Switzerland and an annual incidence rate of  cases per  inhabitants in Sweden 
Shingles lesions and the associated pain often described as burning tend to occur on the skin that is innervated by one or two adjacent sensory nerves almost always on one side of the body only The skin lesions usually subside over the course of several weeks while the pain often persists longer In  to  of cases the pain persists more than three months a chronic and often disabling condition known as postherpetic neuralgia Other serious complications of varicella zoster infection include Mollarets meningitis zoster multiplex and inflammation of arteries in the brain leading to stroke myelitis herpes ophthalmicus or zoster sine herpete In Ramsay Hunt syndrome VZV affects the geniculate ganglion giving lesions that follow specific branches of the facial nerve Symptoms may include painful blisters on the tongue and ear along with one sided facial weakness and hearing loss If infected during initial stages of pregnancy severe damage to the fetus can take place Reyes syndrome can happen after initial infection causing continuous vomiting and signs of brain dysfunction like extreme drowsiness or combative behavior In some cases death or coma can follow Reyes syndrome mostly affects children and teenagers using aspirin during infection can increase this risk
VZV is closely related to the herpes simplex viruses HSV sharing much genome homology The known envelope glycoproteins gB gC gE gH gI gK gL correspond with those in HSV however there is no equivalent of HSV gD VZV also fails to produce the LAT latencyassociated transcripts that play an important role in establishing HSV latency herpes simplex virus VZV virions are spherical and – nm in diameter Their lipid envelope encloses the  nm nucleocapsid of  hexameric and pentameric capsomeres arranged in an icosahedral form Its DNA is a single linear doublestranded molecule  nt long The capsid is surrounded by loosely associated proteins known collectively as the tegument many of these proteins play critical roles in initiating the process of virus reproduction in the infected cell The tegument is in turn covered by a lipid envelope studded with glycoproteins that are displayed on the exterior of the virion each approximately  nm long
The genome was first sequenced in  It is a linear duplex DNA molecule a laboratory strain has  base pairs  The genome has  predominant isomers depending on the orientation of the S segment P prototype and IS inverted S which are present with equal frequency for a total frequency of –  The L segment can also be inverted resulting in a total of four linear isomers IL and ILS  This is distinct from HSVs equiprobable distribution and the discriminatory mechanism is not known  A small percentage of isolated molecules are circular genomes about which little is known  It is known that HSV circularizes on infection There are at least  open reading frames in the genome
Commonality with HSV and HSV indicates a common ancestor five genes out of about  do not have corresponding HSV genes Relation with other human herpes viruses is less strong but many homologues and conserved gene blocks are still found
There are at least five clades of this virus Clades  and  include EuropeanNorth American strains clade  are Asian strains especially from Japan and clade  appears to be based in India Clade  includes some strains from Europe but its geographic origins need further clarification There are also four genotypes that do not fit into these clades Allocation of VZV strains to clades required sequence of whole virus genome Practically all molecular epidemiological data on global VZV strains distribution are obtained with targeted sequencing of selected regions
Phylogenetic analysis of VZV genomic sequences resolves wildtype strains into  genotypes E E J M M M M VIII and IX Complete sequences for M and M strains are unavailable but targeted analyses of representative strains suggest they are stable circulating VZV genotypes Sequence analysis of VZV isolates identified both shared and specific markers for every genotype and validated a unified VZV genotyping strategy Despite high genotype diversity no evidence for intragenotypic recombination was observed Five of seven VZV genotypes were reliably discriminated using only four single nucleotide polymorphisms SNP present in ORF and the E and E genotypes were resolved using SNP located in ORF ORF or ORF Sequence analysis of  clinical varicella and zoster specimens from  European countries identified the following distribution of VZV genotypes E   E   M   M   M   No M or J strains were observed Of  clinical varicella and zoster isolates from Australia and New Zealand typed using this approach  of  eastern Australian isolates were E  were E  were J  were M and  were M  of  New Zealand isolates were E  were E and  were M
The mutation rate for synonymous and nonsynonymous mutation rates among the herpesviruses have been estimated at  × − and  × − mutationssiteyear respectively based on the highly conserved gB gene
Within the human body it can be treated by a number of drugs and therapeutic agents including acyclovir for the chicken pox famciclovir valaciclovir for the shingles zosterimmune globulin ZIG and vidarabine Acyclovir is frequently used as the drug of choice in primary VZV infections and beginning its administration early can significantly shorten the duration of any symptoms However reaching an effective serum concentration of acyclovir typically requires intravenous administration making its use more difficult outside of a hospital
A live attenuated VZV OkaMerck strain vaccine is available and is marketed in the United States under the trade name Varivax It was developed by Merck Sharp  Dohme in the s from the Oka strain virus isolated and attenuated by Michiaki Takahashi and colleagues in the s It was submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration for approval in  and was approved in  Since then it has been added to the recommended vaccination schedules for children in Australia the United States and many other countries  Varicella vaccination has raised concerns in some that the immunity induced by the vaccine may not be lifelong possibly leaving adults vulnerable to more severe disease as the immunity from their childhood immunization wanes  Vaccine coverage in the United States in the population recommended for vaccination is approaching  with concomitant reductions in the incidence of varicella cases and hospitalizations and deaths due to VZVcitation needed So far clinical data has proved that the vaccine is effective for over ten years in preventing varicella infection in healthy individuals and when breakthrough infections do occur illness is typically mild In  the CDCs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ACIP recommended a second dose of vaccine before school entry to ensure the maintenance of high levels of  varicella immunity
In  the United States Food and Drug Administration approved Zostavax for the prevention of shingles  Zostavax is a more concentrated formulation of the Varivax vaccine designed to elicit an immune response in older adults whose immunity to VZV wanes with advancing age A systematic review by the Cochrane Library shows that Zostavax reduces the incidence of shingles by almost 
Shingrix is a V zoster subunit vaccine glycoprotein E developed by GlaxoSmithKline which was approved in the United States by the FDA in October  The ACIP recommended Shingrix for adults over the age of  including those who have already received Zostavax The committee voted that Shingrix is preferred over Zostavax for the prevention of zoster and related complications because phase  clinical data showed vaccine efficacy of  against shingles across all age groups as well as sustained efficacy over a year followup Unlike Zostavax which is given as a single shot Shingrix is given as two intramuscular doses two to six months apart This vaccine has shown to be immunogenic and safe in adults with human immunodeficiency virus
Chickenpoxlike rashes were recognised and described by ancient civilizations  the relationship between zoster and chickenpox was not realized until  In  the similarity between virus particles isolated from the lesions of zoster and those from chickenpox was noted In  the first chickenpox vaccine was introduced
Etymology "A member of the family Herpesviridae varicella zoster virus VZV is named for the  main diseases chickenpox and herpes zoster shingles it causes Varicella may be a diminutive of variola because it was considered a mild form of smallpox Variola was coined by Rudolph Augustin Vogel in  and is possibly derived from the Latin varus pimple or varius speckled Herpes zoster derives from the Greek terms herpein to creep and zoster belt Not until the twentieth century was VZV recognized as the cause of both these diseases"
