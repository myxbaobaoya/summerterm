Enterovirus is a genus of positivesense singlestranded RNA viruses associated with several human and mammalian diseases Enteroviruses are named by their transmissionroute through the intestine enteric meaning intestinal
Serologic studies have distinguished  human enterovirus serotypes on the basis of antibody neutralization tests Additional antigenic variants have been defined within several of the serotypes on the basis of reduced or nonreciprocal crossneutralization between variant strains On the basis of their pathogenesis in humans and animals the enteroviruses were originally classified into four groups polioviruses Coxsackie A viruses CA Coxsackie B viruses CB and echoviruses but it was quickly realized that there were significant overlaps in the biological properties of viruses in the different groups Enteroviruses isolated more recently are named with a system of consecutive numbers EVD EVB EVD EVA etc where genotyping is based on the VP capsid region
Enteroviruses affect millions of people worldwide each year and are often found in the respiratory secretions eg saliva sputum or nasal mucus and stool of an infected person Historically poliomyelitis was the most significant disease caused by an enterovirus namely poliovirus There are  nonpolio and  polio enteroviruses that can cause disease in humans Of the  nonpolio types there are  Coxsackie A viruses  Coxsackie B viruses  echoviruses and  other enteroviruses
Poliovirus as well as coxsackie and echovirus is spread through the fecaloral route Infection can result in a wide variety of symptoms including those of mild respiratory illness the common cold hand foot and mouth disease acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis aseptic meningitis myocarditis severe neonatal sepsislike disease acute flaccid paralysis and the related acute flaccid myelitis
Enteroviruses are members of the picornavirus family a large and diverse group of small RNA viruses characterized by a single positivestrand genomic RNA All enteroviruses contain a genome of approximately  bases and are known to have a high mutation rate due to lowfidelity replication and frequent recombination After infection of the host cell the genome is translated in a capindependent manner into a single polyprotein which is subsequently processed by virusencoded proteases into the structural capsid proteins and the nonstructural proteins which are mainly involved in the replication of the virus
RNA recombination appears to be a major driving force in the evolution of enteroviruses as well as in the shaping of their genetic architecture The mechanism of recombination of the RNA genome likely involves template strand switching during RNA replication a process known as copy choice recombination RNA recombination is considered to be an adaptation for dealing with RNA genome damage and a source of genetic diversity It is also a source of concern for vaccination strategies because live attenuatedmutated strains used for vaccination could potentially recombine with wildtype related strains as has been the case with circulating vaccine derived polio viruses cVDPDs The capsid region and especially VP is a recombination coldspot and this is one of the main reasons to use this region for genotyping However the UTR  capsid junction and the beginning of the P region have been observed to recombine very frequently although recombinations do occur in the rest of the genome as well Interestingly the enterovirus species EVA EVB EVC EVD have not been observed so far to exchange genomic regions among them with the exception of the UTR 
Enteroviruses are a group of ubiquitous viruses that cause a number of infections which are usually mild The genus picornavirus includes enteroviruses and rhinoviruses
Enterovirus A include coxsackievirus A A A A A A A A A A A and enterovirus A A A A A A A A A A A A simian virus  A simian virus  A simian virus  A baboon enterovirus A Some viruses initially reported as novel have been found to be misidentified Thus coxsackievirus A is the same serotype as echovirus  and coxsackievirus A is the same serotype as coxsackievirus A and coxsackievirus A is the same serotype as coxsackievirus ACoxsackie A virus causes human hand foot and mouth disease
Enterovirus B includes coxsackievirus B  coxsackievirus A echovirus  and enterovirus B Coxsackie B viruses are found worldwide and can cause myocarditis inflammation of the heart pericarditis inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart meningitis inflammation of the membranes that line the brain and spinal cord and pancreatitis inflammation of the pancreas The Coxsackie B viruses are also reported to cause a spastic paralysis due to the degeneration of neuronal tissue and muscle injury Infections usually occur during warm summer months with symptoms including  exanthema pleurodynia flulike illness consisting of fever fatigue malaise myalgia nausea abdominal pain and vomiting   Echoviruses are a cause of many of the nonspecific viral infections that can range from minor illness to severe potentially fatal conditions such as aseptic meningitis encephalitis paralysis and myocarditis It is mainly found in the intestine and can cause nervous disorders Type B enteroviruses are responsible for a vast number of mild and acute infections They have been reported to remain in the body causing persistent infections contributing to chronic diseases such as type I diabetes
Enterovirus C consists of polioviruses  and  coxsackieviruses A A A A A  A A A and enterovirus C C C C C C C C C The three serotypes of poliovirus PV PV and PV each have a slightly different capsid protein Capsid proteins define cellular receptor specificity and virus antigenicity PV is the most common type to cause infection in humans however all three forms are extremely contagious spreading through persontoperson contact Poliovirus causes Polio or Poliomyelitis which is a disabling and lifethreatening disease that causes paresthesia meningitis and permanent paralysis Symptoms can include sore throat fever tiredness nausea headache and stomach pain although  of those that get infected will not display visible symptoms There are two types of vaccines available to prevent polio inactivated poliovirus vaccine given as an injection in the leg IPV or arm and oral poliovirus vaccine OPV The polio vaccine is highly efficacious giving protection to  out of  children vaccinated
Enteroviruses are usually only capable of producing acute infections that are rapidly cleared by the adaptive immune response However genome mutations which enterovirus B serotypes may acquire in the host during the acute phase may transform these viruses into the noncytolytic form also known as noncytopathic or defective enterovirus This is a mutated quasispecies of enterovirus which can cause persistent infection in human cardiac tissues especially in some patients with myocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathy In persistent infections viral RNA is present only on very low levels and is not believed to contribute to any ongoing myocardial disease being a fading remnant of a recent acute infection although some scientists think otherwise
EVD first was identified in California in  Compared with other enteroviruses it has been rarely reported in the US in the past  years Most people who get infected are infants children and teens EVD usually causes mild to severe respiratory illness however the full spectrum of EVD illness is not welldefined Most start with common cold symptoms of runny nose and cough Some but not all may also have fever For more severe cases difficulty breathing wheezing or problems catching your breath may occur As of October   there has been one death in New Jersey directly linked to EVD as well as one death in Rhode Islandcitation needed attributed to a combination of EVD and sepsis caused by an infection of staphylococcus aureus
Enterovirus A EVA is notable as one of the major causative agents for hand foot and mouth disease HFMD and is sometimes associated with severe central nervous system diseases EVA was first isolated and characterized from cases of neurological disease in California in  To date little is known about the molecular mechanisms of host response to EVA infection but increases in the level of mRNAs encoding chemokines proteins involved in protein degradation complement proteins and proapoptotis proteins have been implicated
There are three serotypes of poliovirus PV PV and PV each with a slightly different capsid protein Capsid proteins define cellular receptor specificity and virus antigenicity PV is the most common form encountered in nature however all three forms are extremely infectious Poliovirus can affect the spinal cord and cause poliomyelitis
Polioviruses were formerly classified as a species belonging to the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae The Poliovirus species has been eliminated from the genus Enterovirus The following serotypes Human poliovirus  Human poliovirus  and Human poliovirus  were assigned to the species Human enterovirus C in the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae The type species of the genus Enterovirus was changed from Poliovirus to Human enterovirus C This has been ratified in April  The th Executive Committee EC of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ICTV met in Canada during June  with new taxonomic proposals
Two of the proposals with three changes were
Proposals approved at the EC meeting of  were sent to members of ICTV via email for ratification and have become official taxonomy  There have been a total of  taxonomic proposals which have been approved and ratified since the th ICTV Report of 
The ratification process was performed by email The proposals were sent electronically via email on March   to ICTV members with a request to vote on whether to ratify the taxonomic proposals with a month deadline
The following are two of the taxonomic proposals with three changes that were ratified by ICTV members in April 
Picornaviruses
Enteroviruses cause a wide range of symptoms and while their long list of signs and symptoms should put them on the differential diagnosis list of many illnesses they often go unnoticed Enteroviruses can cause anything from rashes in small children to summer colds to encephalitis to blurred vision to pericarditis Enteroviral infections have a great range in presentation and seriousness  Non polio enteroviruses cause – million infections and tens of thousands of hospitalizations in the US each year Enteroviruses can be identified through cell culture or PCR assay collected from fecal or respiratory specimens Below are common enterovirus related diseases including poliomyelitis 
Encephalitis lethargica the – "sleeping sickness"
Enterovirus has been speculated to be connected with Type  diabetes It has been proposed that type  diabetes is a virustriggered autoimmune response in which the immune system attacks virusinfected cells along with the insulinproducing beta cells in the pancreas A team working at University of Tampere Finland has identified a type of enterovirus that has a possible link to type  diabetes which is an autoimmune disease
Most people who contract enterovirus have mild symptoms lasting about a week Those with higher risk may have more complications sometimes becoming fatal The most common sign of enterovirus is a common cold More intense symptoms of enterovirus include hypoxia aseptic meningitis conjunctivitis hand foot and mouth disease and paralysis
Treatment for enteroviral infection is mainly supportive In cases of pleurodynia treatment consists of analgesics to relieve the severe pain that occurs in patients with the disease in some severe cases opiates may be needed Treatment for aseptic meningitis caused by enteroviruses is also mainly symptomatic In patients with enteroviral carditis treatment consists of the prevention and treatment of complications such as arrhythmias pericardial effusion and cardiac failure Other treatments that have been investigated for enteroviral carditis include intravenous immunoglobulin
The enterovirus genus includes the following fifteen species
These fifteen species serotype include
