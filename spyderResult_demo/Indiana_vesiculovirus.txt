Indiana vesiculovirus formerly Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus VSIV or VSV is a virus in the family Rhabdoviridae the wellknown Rabies lyssavirus belongs to the same family VSIV can infect insects cattle horses and pigs It has particular importance to farmers in certain regions of the world where it infects cattle This is because its clinical presentation is identical to the very important foot and mouth disease virus
The virus is zoonotic and leads to a flulike illness in infected humans
It is also a common laboratory virus used to study the properties of viruses in the family Rhabdoviridae as well as to study viral evolution
Indiana vesiculovirus is the prototypic member of the genus Vesiculovirus of the family Rhabdoviridae VSIV is an arbovirus and its replication occurs in the cytoplasm Natural VSIV infections encompass two steps cytolytic infections of mammalian hosts and transmission by insects In insects infections are noncytolytic persistent One confirmed vector of the virus is the phlebotomine sand fly Lutzomyia shannoni The genome of VSIV is on a single molecule of negativesense RNA that has  nucleotides in length that encodes five major proteins G protein G large protein L phosphoprotein P matrix protein M and nucleoprotein N
The VSIV G protein aka VSVG enables viral entry It mediates viral attachment to an LDL receptor LDLR or an LDLR family member present on the host cell Following binding the VSIVLDLR complex is rapidly endocytosed  It then mediates fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane VSIV enters the cell through partially clathrincoated vesicles viruscontaining vesicles contain more clathrin and clathrin adaptor than conventional vesicles Viruscontaining vesicles recruit components of the actin machinery for their interaction thus inducing its own uptake  VSIV G does not follow the same path as most vesicles because transport of the G protein from the ER to the plasma membrane is interrupted by incubation at  °C  Under this condition the molecules accumulate in both the ER and a subcellular vesicle fraction of low density called the lipidrich vesicle fraction  The material in the lipidrich vesicle fraction appears to be a postER intermediate in the transport process to the plasma membrane PM  After infection the VSIV G gene is expressed and is commonly studied as a model for Nlinked glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum ER It is translated into the rough ER where the GlcManGlcNac oligosaccharide is added by a dolicholcontaining protein to an NXS motif on VSIV G Sugars are removed gradually as the protein travels to the Golgi apparatus and it becomes resistant to endoglycosidase H When synthesized in polarized epithelial cells the envelope glycoprotein VSV G is targeted to the basolateral PM VSVG is also a common coat protein for lentiviral vector expression systems used to introduce genetic material into in vitro systems or animal models mainly because of its extremely broad tropism
The VSIV L protein is encoded by half the genome and combines with the phosphoprotein to catalyze replication of the mRNA
The VSIV M protein is encoded by an mRNA that is  nucleotides long and translates to a  amino acidprotein  The predicted M protein sequence does not contain any long hydrophobic or nonpolar domains that might promote membrane association The protein is rich in basic amino acids and contains a highly basic amino terminal domain
The VSV N protein is required to initiate genome synthesis
The main sign in animals is oral disease appearing as mucosal vesicles and ulcers in the mouth but also on the udder and around the coronary band Animals may show systemic signs such as anorexia lethargy and pyrexia fever Disease usually resolves within two weeks and animals usually recover completely
Cases of human infection with vesicular stomatitis virus have been described  Most of these cases have been among laboratory workers veterinarians and livestock handlers  In most cases VSV infection has resulted in a short  to  day illness characterized by fever headache myalgia weakness and occasionally vesicular lesions of the mouth  Serological testing is most commonly performed with an ELISA or complement fixation and viral isolation can also be attempted
No specific treatment is available but some animals may require supportive fluids or antibiotics for secondary infections
Control relies on biosecurity protocols quarantine isolation and disinfection to ensure the viral disease does not enter a country or herd
In healthy human cells the virus cannot reproduce likely because of the interferon response which allows the cells to adequately respond to viral infection The same cannot be said of interferon nonresponsive cancer cells a quality which allows VSIV to grow and lyse oncogenic cells preferentially
Recently attenuated VSIV with a mutation in its M protein has been found to have oncolytic properties  Research is ongoing and has shown VSIV to reduce tumor size and spread in melanoma lung cancer colon cancer and certain brain tumors in laboratory models of cancer
VSIV was modified to attack HIVinfected Tcells  The modified virus was called a "trojan horse" virus 
Recombinant VSIV has undergone phase  trials as a vaccine for Ebola virus 
Recombinant VSIV expressing the Ebola virus glycoprotein has undergone phase III trials in Africa as a vaccine for Ebola virus disease The vaccine was shown to be  effective in preventing Ebola virus disease see also rVSVZEBOV vaccine In December  Merck  Cos rVSVZEBOV vaccine Ervebo was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat individuals  and older
Replication competent rVSV has also been created expressing proteins of Lassa fever and Marburg virus
The VSIV G protein is routinely used in biomedical research to pseudotype retroviral and lentiviral vectors conferring the ability to transduce a broad range of mammalian cell types with genes of interest
The VSIV G protein has also been used in cytological studies of trafficking in the endomembrane system  Immunoelectron microscopy suggests that VSIV G protein moves from cis to trans Golgi bodies without being transported between them in vesicles supporting the cisternal maturation model of Golgi trafficking
VSV is often used to perform quantitative and computational studies on viral genome replication and transcription Such studies help build a better understanding of viral behavior in the presence and absence of innate immune response
In  a possible vaccine against COVID the disease caused by SARSCoV was developed based on modified VSV The modification involved replacing the VSVs surface protein genes with those for SARSCoVs spike proteins
