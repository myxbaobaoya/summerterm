The Epstein–Barr virus EBV formally called Human gammaherpesvirus  is one of the nine known human herpesvirus types in the herpes family and is one of the most common viruses in humans EBV is a doublestranded DNA virus
It is best known as the cause of infectious mononucleosis "mono" or "glandular fever" It is also associated with various nonmalignant premalignant and malignant Epstein–Barr virusassociated lymphoproliferative diseases such as Burkitt lymphoma hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and Hodgkins lymphoma nonlymphoid malignancies such as gastric cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma and conditions associated with human immunodeficiency virus such as hairy leukoplakia and central nervous system lymphomas The virus is also associated with the childhood disorders of Alice in Wonderland syndrome and acute cerebellar ataxia and based on some evidence higher risks of developing certain autoimmune diseases especially dermatomyositis systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögrens syndrome About  cancer cases globally per year are thought to be attributable to EBV In  a large study population of  million over  years suggested EBV as the leading cause of multiple sclerosis with a recent EBV infection causing a fold increase in the risk of developing multiple sclerosis
Infection with EBV occurs by the oral transfer of saliva and genital secretions
Most people become infected with EBV and gain adaptive immunity In the United States about half of all fiveyearold children and about  of adults have evidence of previous infection Infants become susceptible to EBV as soon as maternal antibody protection disappears Many children become infected with EBV and these infections usually cause no symptoms or are indistinguishable from the other mild brief illnesses of childhood In the United States and other developed countries many people are not infected with EBV in their childhood years When infection with EBV occurs during adolescence it causes infectious mononucleosis  to  of the time
EBV infects B cells of the immune system and epithelial cells Once EBVs initial lytic infection is brought under control EBV latency persists in the individuals memory B cells for the rest of their life
The virus is about – nm in diameter and is composed of a double helix of deoxyribonucleic acid DNA which contains about  base pairs encoding  genes The DNA is surrounded by a protein nucleocapsid which is surrounded by a tegument made of protein which in turn is surrounded by an  envelope containing both lipids and surface projections of glycoproteins which are essential to infection of the host cell In July  a team of researchers reported the first complete atomic model of the nucleocapsid of the virus This "first complete atomic model includes the icosahedral capsid the capsidassociated tegument complex CATC and the dodecameric portalthe viral genome translocation apparatus"

The term viral tropism refers to which cell types that EBV infects EBV can infect different cell types including B cells and epithelial cells
The viral threepart glycoprotein complexes of gHgL gp mediate B cell membrane fusion although the twopart complexes of gHgL mediate epithelial cell membrane fusion EBV that are made in the B cells have low numbers of gHgLgp complexes because these threepart complexes interact with Humanleukocyteantigen class II molecules present in B cells in the endoplasmic reticulum and are degraded In contrast EBV from epithelial cells are rich in the threepart complexes because these cells do not normally contain HLA class II molecules As a consequence EBV made from B cells are more infectious to epithelial cells and EBV made from epithelial cells are more infectious to B cells  Viruses lacking the gp portion are able to bind to human B cells but unable to infect
EBV can infect both B cells and epithelial cells The mechanisms for entering these two cells are different
To enter B cells viral glycoprotein gp binds to cellular receptor CD also known as CR Then viral glycoprotein gp interacts with cellular MHC class II molecules This triggers fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane allowing EBV to enter the B cell Human CD also known as complement receptor  CR is an additional attachment factor for gp and can provide a route for entry of EBV into CDnegative cells including immature Bcells EBV infection downregulates expression of CD
To enter epithelial cells viral protein BMRF  interacts with cellular β integrins Then viral protein gHgL interacts with cellular αvβαvβ integrins This triggers fusion of the viral envelope with the epithelial cell membrane allowing EBV to enter the epithelial cell Unlike Bcell entry epithelialcell entry is actually impeded by viral glycoprotein gp
Once EBV enters the cell the viral capsid dissolves and the viral genome is transported to the cell nucleuscitation needed
The lytic cycle or productive infection results in the production of infectious virions EBV can undergo lytic replication in both B cells and epithelial cells In B cells lytic replication normally only takes place after reactivation from latency In epithelial cells lytic replication often directly follows viral entry
For lytic replication to occur the viral genome must be linear The latent EBV genome is circular so it must linearize in the process of lytic reactivation During lytic replication viral DNA polymerase is responsible for copying the viral genome This contrasts with latency in which hostcell DNA polymerase copies the viral genome
Lytic gene products are produced in three consecutive stages immediateearly early and late
Immediateearly lytic gene products act as transactivators enhancing the expression of later lytic genes Immediateearly lytic gene products include BZLF also known as Zta EB associated with its product gene ZEBRA and BRLF associated with its product gene Rta
Early lytic gene products have many more functions such as replication metabolism and blockade of antigen processing Early lytic gene products include BNLF
Finally late lytic gene products tend to be proteins with structural roles such as VCA which forms the viral capsid Other late lytic gene products such as BCRF help EBV evade the immune system
EGCG a polyphenol in green tea has shown in a study to inhibit EBV spontaneous lytic infection at the DNA gene transcription and protein levels in a time and dosedependent manner the expression of EBV lytic genes Zta Rta and early antigen complex EAD induced by Rta however the highly stable EBNA gene found across all stages of EBV infection is unaffected   Specific inhibitors to the pathways suggest that RasMEKMAPK pathway contributes to EBV lytic infection though BZLF and PIK pathway through BRLF the latter completely abrogating the ability of a BRLF adenovirus vector to induce the lytic form of EBV infection  Additionally the activation of some genes but not others is being studied to determine just how to induce immune destruction of latently infected Bcells by use of either TPA or sodium butyrate
Unlike lytic replication latency does not result in production of virions
Instead the EBV genome circular DNA resides in the cell nucleus as an episome and is copied by cellular DNA polymerase
In latency only a portion of EBVs genes are expressed
Latent EBV expresses its genes in one of three patterns known as latency programs EBV can latently persist within B cells and epithelial cells but different latency programs are possible in the two types of cellcitation needed
EBV can exhibit one of three latency programs Latency I Latency II or Latency III Each latency program leads to the production of a  limited distinct set of viral proteins and viral RNAs
Also a program is postulated in which all viral protein expression is shut off Latency 
Within B cells all three latency programs are possible
EBV latency within B cells usually progresses from Latency III to Latency II to Latency I Each stage of latency uniquely influences B cell behavior Upon infecting a resting naive B cell EBV enters Latency III The set of proteins and RNAs produced in Latency III transforms the B cell into a proliferating blast also known as B cell activation
Later the virus restricts its gene expression and enters Latency II The more limited set of proteins and RNAs produced in Latency II induces the B cell to differentiate into a memory B cell
Finally EBV restricts gene expression even further and enters Latency I Expression of EBNA allows the EBV genome to replicate when the memory B cell divides
Within epithelial cells only Latency II is possible
In primary infection EBV replicates in oropharyngeal epithelial cells and establishes Latency III II and I infections in Blymphocytes EBV latent infection of Blymphocytes is necessary for virus persistence subsequent replication in epithelial cells and release of infectious virus into saliva EBV Latency III and II infections of Blymphocytes Latency II infection of oral epithelial cells and Latency II infection of NK or Tcell can result in malignancies marked by uniform EBV genome presence and gene expression
Latent EBV in B cells can be reactivated to switch to lytic replication This is known to happen in vivo but what triggers it is not known precisely In vitro latent EBV in B cells can be reactivated by stimulating the B cell receptor so reactivation in vivo probably takes place when latently infected B cells respond to unrelated infections
When EBV infects B cells in vitro lymphoblastoid cell lines eventually emerge that are capable of indefinite growth The growth transformation of these cell lines is the consequence of viral protein expressioncitation needed
EBNA EBNAC and LMP are essential for transformation whereas EBNALP and the EBERs are not
Following natural infection with EBV the virus is thought to execute some or all of its repertoire of gene expression programs to establish a persistent infection Given the initial absence of host immunity the lytic cycle produces large numbers of virions to infect other presumably Blymphocytes within the host
The latent programs reprogram and subvert infected Blymphocytes to proliferate and bring infected cells to the sites at which the virus presumably persists Eventually when host immunity develops the virus persists by turning off most or possibly all of its genes only occasionally reactivating to produce fresh virions A balance is eventually struck between occasional viral reactivation and host immune surveillance removing cells that activate viral gene expression
The site of persistence of EBV may be bone marrow EBVpositive patients who have had their own bone marrow replaced with bone marrow from an EBVnegative donor are found to be EBVnegative after transplantation
All EBV nuclear proteins are produced by alternative splicing of a transcript starting at either the Cp or Wp promoters at the left end of the genome in the conventional nomenclature The genes are ordered EBNALPEBNAEBNAAEBNABEBNACEBNA within the genome
The initiation codon of the EBNALP coding region is created by an alternate splice of the nuclear protein transcript In the absence of this initiation codon EBNAEBNAAEBNABEBNACEBNA will be expressed depending on which of these genes is alternatively spliced into the transcript
EBV can be divided into two major types EBV type  and EBV type  These two subtypes have different EBNA genes As a result the two subtypes differ in their transforming capabilities and reactivation ability Type  is dominant throughout most of the world but the two types are equally prevalent in Africa One can distinguish EBV type  from EBV type  by cutting the viral genome with a restriction enzyme and comparing the resulting digestion patterns by gel electrophoresis
Epstein–Barr virusencoded small RNAs EBERs are by far the most abundant EBV products transcribed in cells infected by EBV They are commonly used as targets for the detection of EBV in histological tissues
EBV causes infectious mononucleosis Children infected with EBV have few symptoms or can appear asymptomatic but when infection is delayed to adolescence or adulthood it can cause fatigue fever inflamed throat swollen lymph nodes in the neck enlarged spleen swollen liver or rash Postinfectious chronic fatigue syndrome has also been associated with EBV infection
EBV has also been implicated in several other diseases including Burkitts lymphoma hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis Hodgkins lymphoma stomach cancer nasopharyngeal carcinoma multiple sclerosis and lymphomatoid granulomatosis
Specifically EBV infected Bcells have been shown to reside within the brain lesions of multiple sclerosis patients and a  study of  million soldiers historical blood samples showed that "Individuals who were not infected with the EpsteinBarr virus virtually never get multiple sclerosis Its only after EpsteinBarr virus infection that the risk of multiple sclerosis jumps up by over fold" and that only EBV of many infections had such a clear connection with the disease
Additional diseases that have been linked to EBV include Gianotti–Crosti syndrome erythema multiforme acute genital ulcers and oral hairy leukoplakia The viral infection is also associated with and often contributes to the development of a wide range of nonmalignant lymphoproliferative diseases such  as severe hypersensitivity mosquito bite allergy reactions EpsteinBarr viruspositive mucocutaneous ulcers and hydroa vacciniforme as well as malignant lymphoproliferative diseases such as Epstein–Barr viruspositive Burkitt lymphoma Epstein–Barr viruspositive Hodgkin lymphoma and primary effusion lymphoma
The Epstein–Barr virus has been implicated  in disorders related to alphasynuclein aggregation eg Parkinsons disease dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy
The Epstein–Barr virus was named after Michael Anthony Epstein and Yvonne Barr who discovered the virus together with Bert Achong In  Epstein a pathologist and expert electron microscopist attended a lecture on "The Commonest Childrens Cancer in Tropical AfricaA Hitherto Unrecognised Syndrome" by Denis Parsons Burkitt a surgeon practicing in Uganda in which Burkitt described the "endemic variant" pediatric form of the disease that bears his name In  a specimen was sent from Uganda to Middlesex Hospital to be cultured Virus particles were identified in the cultured cells and the results were published in The Lancet in  by Epstein Achong and Barr Cell lines were sent to Werner and Gertrude Henle at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia who developed serological markers In  a technician in their laboratory developed mononucleosis and they were able to compare a stored serum sample showing that antibodies to the virus developed In  they discovered that EBV can directly immortalize B cells after infection mimicking some forms of EBVrelated infections and confirmed the link between the virus and infectious mononucleosis
As a relatively complex virus EBV is not yet fully understood Laboratories around the world continue to study the virus and develop new ways to treat the diseases it causes One popular way of studying EBV in vitro is to use bacterial artificial chromosomes Epstein–Barr virus can be maintained and manipulated in the laboratory in continual latency a property shared with Kaposis sarcomaassociated herpesvirus another of the eight human herpesviruses Although many viruses are assumed to have this property during infection of their natural hosts there is not an easily managed system for studying this part of the viral lifecycle  Genomic studies of EBV have been able to explore lytic reactivation and regulation of the latent viral episome
Although under active research an Epstein–Barr virus vaccine is not yet available The development of an effective vaccine could prevent up to  cancers globally per year The absence of effective animal models is an obstacle to development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against EBV
Like other human herpesviruses EpsteinBarr might allow eradication via a course of the prodrug valaciclovir but further research is needed to determine if eradication is actually achievable Antiviral agents act by inhibiting viral DNA replication but there is little evidence that they are effective against Epstein–Barr virus Moreover they are expensive risk causing resistance to antiviral agents and in  to  of cases can cause unpleasant side effects
