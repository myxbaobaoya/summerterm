Sapovirus is a genetically diverse genus of singlestranded positivesense RNA nonenveloped viruses within the family Caliciviridae Together with norovirus sapoviruses are the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis commonly called the "stomach flu" although it is not related to influenza in humans and animals  It is a monotypic taxon containing only one species the Sapporo virus
Natural hosts for the virus are humans and swine The virus is transmitted through oralfecal contact Sapovirus commonly occurs in children and infants and therefore is often spread in nurseries and daycares however it has also been found in longterm care facilities This could be due to a lack of personal hygiene and sanitation measures Common symptoms include diarrhea and vomiting The sapovirus was initially discovered in an outbreak of gastroenteritis in an orphanage in Sapporo Japan in 
Sapovirus is spread via the fecaloral route Infected individuals expel more than

 particlesgram of feces or vomit Particles from the infected individual remain viable for years and an infectious dose can be as few as  particles Contamination of work surfaces hands etc can cause vast number of new infections Infection may occur if the particles are inhaled such as when the particles are aerosolized when those whom are infected vomit or when the toilet is flushed after an infected individual vomits Other forms of transmission include the excessive handling of foods by an infected individual this most commonly occurs in a restaurant setting consumption of shellfish that lived in waters contaminated with infected fecal matter and the ingestion of water that has been contaminated
After an incubation period of – days signs of illness start to arise Symptoms of sapovirus are very similar to those of norovirus The most common symptoms are vomiting and diarrhea however additional symptoms may occur These include chills nausea headache abdominal cramps and myalgiafever is very rare While patients most frequently start to show symptoms after the – day incubation period there have been cases in which an individual is asymptomatic Although the individual does not show symptoms they are still capable of spreading the virus through the general mode of transmission the oralfecal route
General sanitary hygiene is the most important method of preventing sapovirus This can be done by thoroughly washing hands after using the restroom and before eatingpreparing food Contaminated surfaces should be cleaned with disinfectant and or solutions containing bleach Other preventative measures include avoiding contact and sharing drinksfood with infected individuals
There is no specific medication for individuals infected with sapovirus Sapovirus cannot be treated with antibiotics because it is not a bacterial infection Treatments include symptom support such as rehydrating the individual
Sapovirus is a nonenveloped positivesense singlestranded RNA virus about kb in size The virus has a end polyAtail but not a  cap Sapovirus has an icosahedral structure that contains  subunits T The diameter of the capsid is between – nm Like other caliciviruses the capsid of the sapovirus has round intends on its surface However its "Star of David" surface morphology distinguishes it from other caliciviruses
Sapovirus genome is organized into two possibly three wellknown open reading frames ORFs ORF encodes for nonstructural proteins and for VP the main capsid protein VP has two standard domains shell S and protruding P The S proteins function is to "form the scaffold around the nucleic acid" while the P protein is important in forming a "homodimer with the receptors" ORF encodes for minor structural polyproteins VP While there have been predictions of a third ORF ORF there is no proof for what its function is
There have been at least  complete genomes for sapovirus analyzed and identified already all of which can be classified into five categories GIGV which can further be divided into different genetic clusters Four of the five groups GI GII GIV GV can infect humans and these four groups correspond to the four antigenically distinct strains of sapovirus Sapporo Houston London and Stockholm While there are at least  genotypes for this virus new ones continue to be reported in America Asia and Europe
ReversetranscriptionPCR RTPCR is the most commonly used detection tool for sapovirus because of its broad reactivity sensitivity speed and specificity Because of the diversity of the sapovirus hundreds of primers have been designed in order to specifically target and amplify RNAdependent RNApolymerase This can be used to "partially characterize the Sapovirus and investigate the similarity of the detected Sapovirus"
"Sapoviruses are morphologically distinguishable from other gastroenteritis pathogens eg norovirus rotavirus astrovirus or adenovirus by their typical "Star of David" surface morphology under the electron microscope However this has low sensitivity compared to nucleic acid detection methods"
Enzymelinked immunosorbent assays ELISA have been used to detect human sapovirus from clinical samples While ELISA can be used to detect human sapovirus antigens it is not commonly used The diversity of the many strains of sapovirus make it difficult to detect the wide array of antigens that may be presentbecause there are so many antigens possible ELISA is not as accurate or as sensitive as nucleic acid detection methods
The exact replication cycle of sapovirus has not been determined however it is thought to have the same or similar cytoplasmic replication cycle that other caliciviruses display The cytoplasmic replication cycle is as follows
Using electron microscopy the sapovirus was first seen in diarrheic stool samples from the United Kingdom in  and was soon known as a gastroenteritis pathogen While the virus was first seen in the UK "the prototype strain of the genus Sapovirus was from another outbreak in Sapporo Japan in " The first complete genome of sapovirus was interpreted from the Manchester strain in the United Kingdom in   Formerly sapoviruses were called "Sapporolike viruses" however in  they were changed to the species Sapporo virus genus Sapovirus in the family Caliciviridae "Currently the family Caliciviridae consists of five established genera Sapovirus Norovirus Lagovirus Vesivirus and Nebovirus"
One positive result for sapovirus infection was confirmed at Gisborne Hospital in New Zealand Two additional cases were found in staff members and five additional patients were put into isolation Hospital staff used precautionary measures by using personal protection when entering rooms
 faculty members of a college in Taipei County had been diagnosed with sapovirus infections
"Using data from the Oregon and Minnesota public health departments researchers investigated  gastroenteritis outbreaks between  through  Of these  outbreaks  percent were found to be norovirusnegative and  of these were further tested for other gastrointestinal viruses including sapovirus astrovirus adenovirus and rotavirus sapovirus was identified in  outbreaks  percent with  percent of these occurring in long term care facilities Close to half of these cases occurred in  alone" The researchers further explain that while the proportion of sapovirus occurring in the long term care facilities is high it is likely an artifact of legally mandated outbreak reporting
Norovirus is most commonly associated with sapovirus Norovirus and sapovirus genomes are very closely related the distinction between the two can only be made from the differences in their coding strategy and reading frames Noroviruses along with sapoviruses are the most common cause of gastroenteritis and therefore show the same symptoms as each other
Astrovirus like sapovirus causes gastroenteritis in children and the elderly especially those who are immunocompromised While sapovirus has two ORFs Astrovirus has three and also has  recombinant strains Astrovirus replicates within the cytoplasm and are propagated readily in the GI tract
Rotavirus like norovirus astrovirus and sapovirus causes gastroenteritis Rotavirus however is much more lethal causing  of deaths in children with diarrhea and  deaths worldwide
Sapoviruses have been identified in bats California sea lions dogs pigs and mink
