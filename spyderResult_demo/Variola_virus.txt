Smallpox was an infectious disease caused by one of two virus variants Variola major and Variola minor The agent of variola virus VARV belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus The last naturally occurring case was diagnosed in October  and the World Health Organization WHO certified the global eradication of the disease in  making it the only human disease to be eradicated
The initial symptoms of the disease included fever and vomiting This was followed by formation of ulcers in the mouth and a skin rash Over a number of days the skin rash turned into the characteristic fluidfilled blisters with a dent in the center The bumps then scabbed over and fell off leaving scars The disease was spread between people or via contaminated objects Prevention was achieved mainly through the smallpox vaccine Once the disease had developed certain antiviral medication may have helped The risk of death was about  with higher rates among babies Often those who survived had extensive scarring of their skin and some were left blind
The origin of smallpox is unknown however the earliest evidence of the disease dates to the rd century BCE in Egyptian mummies The disease historically occurred in outbreaks In thcentury Europe it is estimated that  people died from the disease per year and that onethird of all cases of blindness were due to smallpox Smallpox is estimated to have killed up to  million people in the th century and around  million people in the last  years of its existence Earlier deaths included six European monarchs As recently as   million cases occurred a year
Inoculation for smallpox appears to have started in China around the s Europe adopted this practice from Asia in the first half of the th century In  Edward Jenner introduced the modern smallpox vaccine In  the WHO intensified efforts to eliminate the disease Smallpox is one of two infectious diseases to have been eradicated the other being rinderpest in  The term "smallpox" was first used in Britain in the early th century to distinguish the disease from syphilis which was then known as the "great pox" Other historical names for the disease include pox speckled monster and red plague
There are two forms of the smallpox virus Variola major is the severe and most common form with a more extensive rash and higher fever Variola minor is a less common presentation causing less severe disease typically discrete smallpox with historical death rates of  or less Subclinical asymptomatic infections with Variola virus were noted but were not common In addition a form called variola sine eruptione smallpox without rash was seen generally in vaccinated persons This form was marked by a fever that occurred after the usual incubation period and could be confirmed only by antibody studies or rarely by viral culture In addition there were two very rare and fulminating types of smallpox the malignant flat and hemorrhagic forms which were usually fatal
The initial symptoms were similar to other viral diseases that are still extant such as influenza and the common cold fever of at least  °C  °F muscle pain malaise headache and fatigue As the digestive tract was commonly involved nausea vomiting and backache often occurred The early prodromal stage usually lasted – days By days – the first visible lesions – small reddish spots called enanthem – appeared on mucous membranes of the mouth tongue palate and throat and the temperature fell to nearnormal These lesions rapidly enlarged and ruptured releasing large amounts of virus into the saliva
Smallpox virus tended to attack skin cells causing the characteristic pimples or macules associated with the disease A rash developed on the skin  to  hours after lesions on the mucous membranes appeared Typically the macules first appeared on the forehead then rapidly spread to the whole face proximal portions of extremities the trunk and lastly to distal portions of extremities The process took no more than  to  hours after which no new lesions appeared At this point variola major infection could take several very different courses which resulted in four types of smallpox disease based on the Rao classification ordinary modified malignant or flat and hemorrhagic smallpox Historically ordinary smallpox had an overall fatality rate of about  and the malignant and hemorrhagic forms were usually fatal The modified form was almost never fatal In early hemorrhagic cases hemorrhages occurred before any skin lesions developed The incubation period between contraction and the first obvious symptoms of the disease was around  days
Ninety percent or more of smallpox cases among unvaccinated persons were of the ordinary type In this form of the disease by the second day of the rash the macules had become raised papules By the third or fourth day the papules had filled with an opalescent fluid to become vesicles This fluid became opaque and turbid within – hours resulting in pustules
By the sixth or seventh day all the skin lesions had become pustules Between seven and ten days the pustules had matured and reached their maximum size The pustules were sharply raised typically round tense and firm to the touch The pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis giving them the feel of a small bead in the skin Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules and by the end of the second week the pustules had deflated and began to dry up forming crusts or scabs By day – scabs had formed over all of the lesions which had started to flake off leaving depigmented scars
Ordinary smallpox generally produced a discrete rash in which the pustules stood out on the skin separately The distribution of the rash was most dense on the face denser on the extremities than on the trunk and denser on the distal parts of the extremities than on the proximal The palms of the hands and soles of the feet were involved in most cases Sometimes the blisters merged into sheets forming a confluent rash which began to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh Patients with confluent smallpox often remained ill even after scabs had formed over all the lesions In one case series the casefatality rate in confluent smallpox was  percent
Referring to the character of the eruption and the rapidity of its development modified smallpox occurred mostly in previously vaccinated people It was rare in unvaccinated people with one case study showing – of modified cases compared to around  in vaccinated people In this form the prodromal illness still occurred but may have been less severe than in the ordinary type There was usually no fever during the evolution of the rash The skin lesions tended to be fewer and evolved more quickly were more superficial and may not have shown the uniform characteristic of more typical smallpox Modified smallpox was rarely if ever fatal This form of variola major was more easily confused with chickenpox
In malignanttype smallpox also called flat smallpox the lesions remained almost flush with the skin at the time when raised vesicles would have formed in the ordinary type It is unknown why some people developed this type Historically it accounted for – percent of cases and most  percent were children Malignant smallpox was accompanied by a severe prodromal phase that lasted – days prolonged high fever and severe symptoms of viremia The prodromal symptoms continued even after the onset of the rash The rash on the mucous membranes enanthem was extensive Skin lesions matured slowly were typically confluent or semiconfluent and by the seventh or eighth day they were flat and appeared to be buried in the skin Unlike ordinarytype smallpox the vesicles contained little fluid were soft and velvety to the touch and may have contained hemorrhages Malignant smallpox was nearly always fatal and death usually occurred between the th and th day of illness Often a day or two before death the lesions turned ashen gray which along with abdominal distension was a bad prognostic sign This form is thought to be caused by deficient cellmediated immunity to smallpox If the person recovered the lesions gradually faded and did not form scars or scabs
Hemorrhagic smallpox is a severe form accompanied by extensive bleeding into the skin mucous membranes gastrointestinal tract and viscera This form develops in approximately two percent of infections and occurs mostly in adults Pustules do not typically form in hemorrhagic smallpox Instead bleeding occurs under the skin making it look charred and black hence this form of the disease is also referred to as variola nigra or "black pox" Hemorrhagic smallpox has very rarely been caused by Variola minor While bleeding may occur in mild cases and not affect outcomes hemorrhagic smallpox is typically fatal Vaccination does not appear to provide any immunity to either form of hemorrhagic smallpox and some cases even occurred among people that were revaccinated shortly before It has two forms
The early or fulminant form of hemorrhagic smallpox referred to as purpura variolosa begins with a prodromal phase characterized by a high fever severe headache and abdominal pain The skin becomes dusky and erythematous and this is rapidly followed by the development of petechiae and bleeding in the skin conjunctiva and mucous membranes Death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present Some people survive a few days longer during which time the skin detaches and fluid accumulates under it rupturing at the slightest injury People are usually conscious until the end or shortly before the end Autopsy reveals petechiae and bleeding in the spleen kidney serous membranes skeletal muscles pericardium liver gonads and bladder Historically this condition was frequently misdiagnosed with the correct diagnosis made only at autopsy This form is more likely to occur in pregnant women than in the general population approximately  of cases in unvaccinated pregnant women were early hemorrhagic smallpox versus roughly  in nonpregnant women and adult males The case fatality rate of early hemorrhagic smallpox approaches 
There is also a later form of hemorrhagic smallpox referred to late hemorrhagic smallpox or variolosa pustula hemorrhagica The prodrome is severe and similar to that observed in early hemorrhagic smallpox and the fever persists throughout the course of the disease Bleeding appears in the early eruptive period but later than that seen in purpura variolosa and the rash is often flat and does not progress beyond the vesicular stage Hemorrhages in the mucous membranes appear to occur less often than in the early hemorrhagic form Sometimes the rash forms pustules which bleed at the base and then undergo the same process as in ordinary smallpox This form of the disease is characterized by a decrease in all of the elements of the coagulation cascade and an increase in circulating antithrombin This form of smallpox occurs anywhere from three to  percent of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain Most people with the latestage form die within eight to  days of illness Among the few who recover the hemorrhagic lesions gradually disappear after a long period of convalescence The case fatality rate for late hemorrhagic smallpox is around  Pregnant women are slightly more likely to experience this form of the disease though not as much as early hemorrhagic smallpox
Smallpox was caused by infection with Variola virus which belongs to the family Poxviridae subfamily Chordopoxvirinae and genus Orthopoxvirus
The date of the appearance of smallpox is not settled It most probably evolved from a terrestrial African rodent virus between  and  years ago The wide range of dates is due to the different records used to calibrate the molecular clock One clade was the Variola major strains the more clinically severe form of smallpox which spread from Asia between  and  years ago A second clade included both Alastrim minor a phenotypically mild smallpox described from the American continents and isolates from West Africa which diverged from an ancestral strain between  and  years before present This clade further diverged into two subclades at least  years ago
A second estimate has placed the separation of variola from Taterapox an Orthopoxvirus of some African rodents including gerbils at  to  years ago This is consistent with archaeological and historical evidence regarding the appearance of smallpox as a human disease which suggests a relatively recent origin If the mutation rate is assumed to be similar to that of the herpesviruses the divergence date of variola from Taterapox has been estimated to be  years ago While this is consistent with the other published estimates it suggests that the archaeological and historical evidence is very incomplete Better estimates of mutation rates in these viruses are needed
Examination of a strain that dates from c  found that this strain was basal to the other presently sequenced strains The mutation rate of this virus is well modeled by a molecular clock Diversification of strains only occurred in the th and th centuries
Variola is a large brickshaped virus measuring approximately  to  nanometers by  to  nm with a single linear double stranded DNA genome  kilobase pairs kbp in size and containing a hairpin loop at each end The two classic varieties of smallpox are variola major and variola minor
Four orthopoxviruses cause infection in humans variola vaccinia cowpox and monkeypox Variola infects only humans in nature although primates and other animals have been infected in an experimental setting Vaccinia cowpox and monkeypox viruses can infect both humans and other animals in nature
The life cycle of poxviruses is complicated by having multiple infectious forms with differing mechanisms of cell entry Poxviruses are unique among human DNA viruses in that they replicate in the cytoplasm of the cell rather than in the nucleus To replicate poxviruses produce a variety of specialized proteins not produced by other DNA viruses the most important of which is a viralassociated DNAdependent RNA polymerase
Both enveloped and unenveloped virions are infectious The viral envelope is made of modified Golgi membranes containing viralspecific polypeptides including hemagglutinin Infection with either variola major or variola minor confers immunity against the other
The genome of Variola major is about  base pairs in length It is made from linear double stranded DNA and contains the coding sequence for about  genes The genes are usually not overlapping and typically occur in blocks that point towards the closer terminal region of the genome The coding sequence of the central region of the genome is highly consistent across orthopoxviruses and the arrangement of genes is consistent across chordopoxviruses
The center of the variola genome contains the majority of the essential viral genes including the genes for structural proteins DNA replication transcription and mRNA synthesis The ends of the genome vary more across strains and species of orthopoxviruses These regions contain proteins that modulate the hosts immune systems and are primarily responsible for the variability in virulence across the orthopoxvirus family These terminal regions in poxviruses are inverted terminal repetitions ITR sequences These sequences are identical but oppositely oriented on either end of the genome leading to the genome being a continuous loop of DNA Components of the ITR sequences include an incompletely base paired AT rich hairpin loop a region of roughly  base pairs necessary for resolving concatomeric DNA a stretch of DNA containing multiple copies of the same sequence a few open reading frames and short tandemly repeating sequences of varying number and length The ITRs of poxviridae vary in length across strains and species The coding sequence for most of the viral proteins in Variola major have at least  similarity with the genome of Vaccinia a related virus used for vaccination against smallpox
Gene expression of variola occurs entirely within the cytoplasm of the host cell and follows a distinct progression during infection After entry of an infectious virion into a host cell synthesis of viral mRNA can be detected within  minutes About half of the viral genome is transcribed prior to the replication of viral DNA The first set of expressed genes are transcribed by preexisting viral machinery packaged within the infecting virion These genes encode the factors necessary for viral DNA synthesis and for transcription of the next set of expressed genes Unlike most DNA viruses DNA replication in variola and other poxviruses takes place within the cytoplasm of the infected cell The exact timing of DNA replication after infection of a host cell varies across the poxviridae Recombination of the genome occurs within actively infected cells Following the onset of viral DNA replication an intermediate set of genes codes for transcription factors of late gene expression The products of the later genes include transcription factors necessary for transcribing the early genes for new virions as well as viral RNA polymerase and other essential enzymes for new viral particles These proteins are then packaged into new infectious virions capable of infecting other cells
Two live samples of Variola major remain one in the United States at the CDC in Atlanta and one at the Vector Institute in Koltsovo Russia Research with the remaining virus samples is tightly controlled and each research proposal must be approved by the WHO and the World Health Assembly WHA Most research on poxviruses is performed using the closely related Vaccinia virus as a model organism Vaccinia virus which is used to vaccinate for smallpox is also under research as a viral vector for vaccines for unrelated diseases
The genome of Variola major was first sequenced in its entirety in the s The complete coding sequence is publicly available onlineThe current reference sequence for Variola major was sequenced from a strain that circulated in India in  In addition there are sequences for samples of other strains that were collected during the WHO eradication campaign A genome browser for a complete database of annotated sequences of Variola and other poxviruses is publicly available through the Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center
The WHO currently bans genetic engineering of the smallpox virus However in  a committee advisory to the WHO voted in favor of allowing editing of the genome of the two remaining samples of Variola major to add a marker gene This gene called GFP or green fluorescent protein would cause live samples of the virus to glow green under fluorescent light The insertion of this gene which would not influence the virulence of the virus would be the only allowed modification of the genome The committee stated the proposed modification would aid in research of treatments by making it easier to assess whether a potential treatment was effective in killing viral samples The recommendation could only take effect if approved by the WHA When the WHA discussed the proposal in  it refrained from taking a formal vote on the proposal stating that it would review individual research proposals one at a time Addition of the GFP gene to the Vaccinia genome is routinely performed during research on the closely related Vaccinia virus
The public availability of variolas complete sequence has raised concerns about the possibility of illicit synthesis of infectious virus Vaccinia a cousin of the smallpox virus was artificially synthesized in  by NIH scientists They used a previously established method that involved using a recombinant viral genome to create a selfreplicating bacterial plasmid that produced viral particles
In  another group synthesized the horsepox virus using publicly available sequence data for horsepox The researchers argued that their work would be beneficial to creating a safer and more effective vaccine for smallpox although an effective vaccine is already available The horsepox virus had previously seemed to have gone extinct raising concern about potential revival of Variola major and causing other scientists to question their motives Critics found it especially concerning that the group was able to recreate viable virus in a short time frame with relatively little cost or effort Although the WHO bans individual laboratories from synthesizing more than  of the genome at a time and purchases of smallpox genome fragments are monitored and regulated a group with malicious intentions could compile from multiple sources the full synthetic genome necessary to produce viable virus
Transmission occurred through inhalation of airborne Variola virus usually droplets expressed from the oral nasal or pharyngeal mucosa of an infected person It was transmitted from one person to another primarily through prolonged facetoface contact with an infected person usually within a distance of  m  feet but could also be spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated objects fomites such as bedding or clothing Rarely smallpox was spread by virus carried in the air in enclosed settings such as buildings buses and trains The virus can cross the placenta but the incidence of congenital smallpox was relatively low Smallpox was not notably infectious in the prodromal period and viral shedding was usually delayed until the appearance of the rash which was often accompanied by lesions in the mouth and pharynx The virus can be transmitted throughout the course of the illness but this happened most frequently during the first week of the rash when most of the skin lesions were intact Infectivity waned in  to  days when scabs formed over the lesions but the infected person was contagious until the last smallpox scab fell off
Smallpox was highly contagious but generally spread more slowly and less widely than some other viral diseases perhaps because transmission required close contact and occurred after the onset of the rash The overall rate of infection was also affected by the short duration of the infectious stage In temperate areas the number of smallpox infections was highest during the winter and spring In tropical areas seasonal variation was less evident and the disease was present throughout the year Age distribution of smallpox infections depended on acquired immunity Vaccination immunity declined over time and was probably lost within thirty years Smallpox was not known to be transmitted by insects or animals and there was no asymptomatic carrier state
Once inhaled the variola virus invaded the mucus membranes of the mouth throat and respiratory tract From there it migrated to regional lymph nodes and began to multiply In the initial growth phase the virus seemed to move from cell to cell but by around the th day widespread lysis of infected cells occurred and the virus could be found in the bloodstream in large numbers a condition known as viremia This resulted in the second wave of multiplication in the spleen bone marrow and lymph nodes
The clinical definition of ordinary smallpox is an illness with acute onset of fever equal to or greater than  °C  °F followed by a rash characterized by firm deepseated vesicles or pustules in the same stage of development without other apparent cause When a clinical case was observed smallpox was confirmed using laboratory tests
Microscopically poxviruses produce characteristic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies the most important of which are known as Guarnieri bodies and are the sites of viral replication Guarnieri bodies are readily identified in skin biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin and appear as pink blobs They are found in virtually all poxvirus infections but the absence of Guarnieri bodies could not be used to rule out smallpox The diagnosis of an orthopoxvirus infection can also be made rapidly by electron microscopic examination of pustular fluid or scabs All orthopoxviruses exhibit identical brickshaped virions by electron microscopy If particles with the characteristic morphology of herpesviruses are seen this will eliminate smallpox and other orthopoxvirus infections
Definitive laboratory identification of Variola virus involved growing the virus on chorioallantoic membrane part of a chicken embryo and examining the resulting pock lesions under defined temperature conditions Strains were characterized by polymerase chain reaction PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism RFLP analysis Serologic tests and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays ELISA which measured Variola virusspecific immunoglobulin and antigen were also developed to assist in the diagnosis of infection
Chickenpox was commonly confused with smallpox in the immediate posteradication era Chickenpox and smallpox could be distinguished by several methods Unlike smallpox chickenpox does not usually affect the palms and soles Additionally chickenpox pustules are of varying size due to variations in the timing of pustule eruption smallpox pustules are all very nearly the same size since the viral effect progresses more uniformly A variety of laboratory methods were available for detecting chickenpox in the evaluation of suspected smallpox cases

The earliest procedure used to prevent smallpox was inoculation with variola minor known as variolation after the introduction of smallpox vaccine to avoid possible confusion which likely occurred in India Africa and China well before the practice arrived in Europe The idea that inoculation originated in India has been challenged as few of the ancient Sanskrit medical texts described the process of inoculation Accounts of inoculation against smallpox in China can be found as early as the late th century and the procedure was widely practiced by the th century during the Ming dynasty If successful inoculation produced lasting immunity to smallpox Because the person was infected with Variola virus a severe infection could result and the person could transmit smallpox to others Variolation had a – percent mortality rate considerably less than the – percent mortality rate of the disease Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in  one by Dr Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu observed smallpox inoculation during her stay in the Ottoman Empire writing detailed accounts of the practice in her letters and enthusiastically promoted the procedure in England upon her return in  According to Voltaire  the Turks derived their use of inoculation from neighbouring Circassia Voltaire does not speculate on where the Circassians derived their technique from though he reports that the Chinese have practiced it "these hundred years" In  Cotton Mather and colleagues provoked controversy in Boston by inoculating hundreds After publishing The present method of inoculating for the smallpox in  Dr Thomas Dimsdale was invited to Russia to variolate the Empress Catherine the Great of Russia and her son Grand Duke Paul which he successfully did in   In  Edward Jenner a doctor in Berkeley Gloucestershire rural England discovered that immunity to smallpox could be produced by inoculating a person with material from a cowpox lesion Cowpox is a poxvirus in the same family as variola Jenner called the material used for inoculation vaccine from the root word vacca which is Latin for cow The procedure was much safer than variolation and did not involve a risk of smallpox transmission Vaccination to prevent smallpox was soon practiced all over the world During the th century the cowpox virus used for smallpox vaccination was replaced by the vaccinia virus Vaccinia is in the same family as cowpox and variola but is genetically distinct from both The origin of the vaccinia virus and how it came to be in the vaccine are not known
The current formulation of the smallpox vaccine is a live virus preparation of the infectious vaccinia virus The vaccine is given using a bifurcated twopronged needle that is dipped into the vaccine solution The needle is used to prick the skin usually the upper arm several times in a few seconds If successful a red and itchy bump develops at the vaccine site in three or four days In the first week the bump becomes a large blister called a "Jennerian vesicle" which fills with pus and begins to drain During the second week the blister begins to dry up and a scab forms The scab falls off in the third week leaving a small scar
The antibodies induced by the vaccinia vaccine are crossprotective for other orthopoxviruses such as monkeypox cowpox and variola smallpox viruses Neutralizing antibodies are detectable  days after firsttime vaccination and seven days after revaccination Historically the vaccine has been effective in preventing smallpox infection in  percent of those vaccinated Smallpox vaccination provides a high level of immunity for three to five years and decreasing immunity thereafter If a person is vaccinated again later the immunity lasts even longer Studies of smallpox cases in Europe in the s and s demonstrated that the fatality rate among persons vaccinated less than  years before exposure was  percent it was  percent among those vaccinated  to  years prior and  percent among those vaccinated  or more years before infection By contrast  percent of unvaccinated persons died
There are side effects and risks associated with the smallpox vaccine In the past about  out of  people vaccinated for the first time experienced serious but nonlifethreatening reactions including toxic or allergic reaction at the site of the vaccination erythema multiforme spread of the vaccinia virus to other parts of the body and spread to other individuals Potentially lifethreatening reactions occurred in  to  people out of every  million people vaccinated for the first time Based on past experience it is estimated that  or  people in  million  percent who receive the vaccine may die as a result most often the result of postvaccinial encephalitis or severe necrosis in the area of vaccination called progressive vaccinia
Given these risks as smallpox became effectively eradicated and the number of naturally occurring cases fell below the number of vaccineinduced illnesses and deaths routine childhood vaccination was discontinued in the United States in  and was abandoned in most European countries in the early s Routine vaccination of health care workers was discontinued in the US in  and among military recruits in  although military personnel deploying to the Middle East and Korea still receive the vaccination By  routine vaccination had ceased in all countries It is now primarily recommended for laboratory workers at risk for occupational exposure However the possibility of smallpox virus being used as a biological weapon has rekindled interest in the development of newer vaccines
Smallpox vaccination within three days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms in the vast majority of people Vaccination four to seven days after exposure can offer some protection from disease or may modify the severity of the disease Other than vaccination treatment of smallpox is primarily supportive such as wound care and infection control fluid therapy and possible ventilator assistance Flat and hemorrhagic types of smallpox are treated with the same therapies used to treat shock such as fluid resuscitation People with semiconfluent and confluent types of smallpox may have therapeutic issues similar to patients with extensive skin burns
In July  the Food and Drug Administration approved tecovirimat the first drug approved for treatment of smallpox Antiviral treatments have improved since the last large smallpox epidemics and studies suggest that the antiviral drug cidofovir might be useful as a therapeutic agent The drug must be administered intravenously and may cause serious kidney toxicity
ACAM is a smallpox vaccine developed by Acambis It was approved for use in the United States by the US FDA on August   It contains live vaccinia virus cloned from the same strain used in an earlier vaccine Dryvax While the Dryvax virus was cultured in the skin of calves and freezedried ACAMs virus is cultured in kidney epithelial cells Vero cells from an African green monkey Efficacy and adverse reaction incidence are similar to Dryvax The vaccine is not routinely available to the US public it is however used in the military and maintained in the Strategic National Stockpile
In June  brincidofovir was approved for medical use in the United States for the treatment of human smallpox disease caused by variola virus
The mortality rate from variola minor is approximately  while the mortality rate from variola major is approximately 
Ordinary typeconfluent is fatal about – of the time ordinarytype semiconfluent about – of the time in cases where the rash is discrete the casefatality rate is less than  The overall fatality rate for children younger than  year of age is – Hemorrhagic and flat types have the highest fatality rates The fatality rate for flat or late hemorrhagic type smallpox is  or greater and nearly  is observed in cases of early hemorrhagic smallpox The casefatality rate for variola minor is  or less There is no evidence of chronic or recurrent infection with Variola virus In cases of flat smallpox in vaccinated people the condition was extremely rare but less lethal with one case series showing a  death rate
In fatal cases of ordinary smallpox death usually occurs between days  of the illness The cause of death from smallpox is not clear but the infection is now known to involve multiple organs Circulating immune complexes overwhelming viremia or an uncontrolled immune response may be contributing factors In early hemorrhagic smallpox death occurs suddenly about six days after the fever develops The cause of death in early hemorrhagic cases is commonly due to heart failure and pulmonary edema In late hemorrhagic cases high and sustained viremia severe platelet loss and poor immune response were often cited as causes of death In flat smallpox modes of death are similar to those in burns with loss of fluid protein and electrolytes and fulminating sepsis
Complications of smallpox arise most commonly in the respiratory system and range from simple bronchitis to fatal pneumonia Respiratory complications tend to develop on about the eighth day of the illness and can be either viral or bacterial in origin Secondary bacterial infection of the skin is a relatively uncommon complication of smallpox When this occurs the fever usually remains elevated
Other complications include encephalitis  in  patients which is more common in adults and may cause temporary disability permanent pitted scars most notably on the face and complications involving the eyes  of all cases Pustules can form on the eyelid conjunctiva and cornea leading to complications such as conjunctivitis keratitis corneal ulcer iritis iridocyclitis and atrophy of the optic nerve Blindness results in approximately  of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages In  of young children with smallpox virions reach the joints and bone causing osteomyelitis variolosa Bony lesions are symmetrical most common in the elbows legs and characteristically cause separation of the epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions Swollen joints limit movement and arthritis may lead to limb deformities ankylosis malformed bones flail joints and stubby fingers
Between  and  of survivors are marked with deep pitted scars pockmarks most prominent on the face
The earliest credible clinical evidence of smallpox is found in the descriptions of smallpoxlike disease in medical writings from ancient India as early as  BCE and China  BCE as well as a study of the Egyptian mummy of Ramses V who died more than  years ago  BCE It has been speculated that Egyptian traders brought smallpox to India during the st millennium BCE where it remained as an endemic human disease for at least  years Smallpox was probably introduced into China during the st century CE from the southwest and in the th century was carried from China to Japan In Japan the epidemic of – is believed to have killed as much as onethird of the population At least seven religious deities have been specifically dedicated to smallpox such as the god Sopona in the Yoruba religion in West Africa In India the Hindu goddess of smallpox Shitala was worshipped in temples throughout the country
A different viewpoint is that smallpox emerged  CE and the earlier reported cases were incorrectly identified as smallpox
The timing of the arrival of smallpox in Europe and southwestern Asia is less clear Smallpox is not clearly described in either the Old or New Testaments of the Bible or in the literature of the Greeks or Romans While some have identified the Plague of Athens – which was said to have originated in "Ethiopia" and Egypt – or the plague that lifted Carthages  BCE siege of Syracuse – with smallpox many scholars agree it is very unlikely such a serious disease as variola major would have escaped being described by Hippocrates if it had existed in the Mediterranean region during his lifetime
While the Antonine Plague that swept through the Roman Empire in – CE may have been caused by smallpox Saint Nicasius of Rheims became the patron saint of smallpox victims for having supposedly survived a bout in  and Saint Gregory of Tours recorded a similar outbreak in France and Italy in  the first use of the term variola Other historians speculate that Arab armies first carried smallpox from Africa into Southwestern Europe during the th and th centuries In the th century the Persian physician Rhazes provided one of the most definitive descriptions of smallpox and was the first to differentiate smallpox from measles and chickenpox in his Kitab fi aljadari waalhasbah The Book of Smallpox and Measles During the Middle Ages several smallpox outbreaks occurred in Europe However smallpox had not become established there until the population growth and mobility marked by the Crusades allowed it to do so By the th century smallpox had become entrenched across most of Europe where it had a mortality rate as high as  percent This endemic occurrence of smallpox in Europe is of particular historical importance as successive exploration and colonization by Europeans tended to spread the disease to other nations By the th century smallpox had become a predominant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout much of the world
There were no credible descriptions of smallpoxlike disease in the Americas before the westward exploration by Europeans in the th century CE Smallpox was introduced into the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in  and into the mainland in  when Spanish settlers from Hispaniola arrived in Mexico inadvertently carrying smallpox with them Because the native Amerindian population had no acquired immunity to this new disease their peoples were decimated by epidemics Such disruption and population losses were an important factor in the Spanish achieving conquest of the Aztecs and the Incas Similarly English settlement of the east coast of North America in  in Plymouth Massachusetts was accompanied by devastating outbreaks of smallpox among Native American populations and subsequently among the nativeborn colonists Case fatality rates during outbreaks in Native American populations were as high as  Smallpox was introduced into Australia in  and again in  though colonial surgeons who by  were attempting to distinguish between smallpox and chickenpox which could be almost equally fatal to Aborigines were divided as to whether the – epidemic was chickenpox or smallpox Although smallpox was never endemic on the continent it has been described as the principal cause of death in Aboriginal populations between  and 
By the midth century smallpox was a major endemic disease everywhere in the world except in Australia and small islands untouched by outside exploration In th century Europe smallpox was a leading cause of death killing an estimated  Europeans each year Up to  percent of Swedish infants died of smallpox each year and the death rate of infants in Russia might have been even higher The widespread use of variolation in a few countries notably Great Britain its North American colonies and China somewhat reduced the impact of smallpox among the wealthy classes during the latter part of the th century but a real reduction in its incidence did not occur until vaccination became a common practice toward the end of the th century Improved vaccines and the practice of revaccination led to a substantial reduction in cases in Europe and North America but smallpox remained almost unchecked everywhere else in the world By the midth century variola minor occurred along with variola major in varying proportions in many parts of Africa Patients with variola minor experience only a mild systemic illness are often ambulant throughout the course of the disease and are therefore able to more easily spread disease Infection with v minor induces immunity against the more deadly variola major form Thus as v minor spread all over the US into Canada the South American countries and Great Britain it became the dominant form of smallpox further reducing mortality rates

The first clear reference to smallpox inoculation was made by the Chinese author Wan Quan – in his Dòuzhěn xīnfǎ 痘疹心法 published in  with earliest hints of the practice in China during the th century In China powdered smallpox scabs were blown up the noses of the healthy People would then develop a mild case of the disease and from then on were immune to it The technique did have a – mortality rate but that was considerably less than the – mortality rate of the disease itself Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in  one by Dr Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers Voltaire  reports that the Chinese had practiced smallpox inoculation "these hundred years" Variolation had also been witnessed in Turkey by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu who later introduced it in the UK
An early mention of the possibility of smallpoxs eradication was made in reference to the work of Johnnie Notions a selftaught inoculator from Shetland Scotland Notions found success in treating people from at least the late s through a method devised by himself despite having no formal medical background His method involved exposing smallpox pus to peat smoke burying it in the ground with camphor for up to  years and then inserting the matter into a persons skin using a knife and covering the incision with a cabbage leaf He was reputed not to have lost a single patient Arthur Edmondston in writings on Notions technique that were published in  stated "Had every practitioner been as uniformly successful in the disease as he was the smallpox might have been banished from the face of the earth without injuring the system or leaving any doubt as to the fact"
The English physician Edward Jenner demonstrated the effectiveness of cowpox to protect humans from smallpox in  after which various attempts were made to eliminate smallpox on a regional scale In Russia in  the first child to receive this treatment was bestowed the name "Vaccinov" by Catherine the Great and was educated at the expense of the nation
The introduction of the vaccine to the New World took place in Trinity Newfoundland in  by Dr John Clinch boyhood friend and medical colleague of Jenner As early as  the Spanish Crown organized the Balmis expedition to transport the vaccine to the Spanish colonies in the Americas and the Philippines and establish mass vaccination programs there The US Congress passed the Vaccine Act of  to ensure that safe smallpox vaccine would be available to the American public By about  a very solid state vaccination program existed in the Dutch East Indies
On August   Bavaria became the first country in the world to introduce compulsory vaccinations  Baden followed in  Prussia in  Württemberg in  Sweden in   and the German Empire in  through the Reichs Vaccination Act  In Lutheran Sweden the Protestant clergy played a pioneering role in voluntary smallpox vaccination as early as   The first vaccination was carried out in Liechtenstein in  and from  it was mandatory to vaccinate
In British India a program was launched to propagate smallpox vaccination through Indian vaccinators under the supervision of European officials Nevertheless British vaccination efforts in India and in Burma in particular were hampered by indigenous preference for inoculation and distrust of vaccination despite tough legislation improvements in the local efficacy of the vaccine and vaccine preservative and education efforts By  the federal government of the United States established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans In  the United Kingdom banned inoculation later progressing to mandatory vaccination The British government introduced compulsory smallpox vaccination by an Act of Parliament in 
In the United States from  to  first Massachusetts and then other states required smallpox vaccination Although some disliked these measures coordinated efforts against smallpox went on and the disease continued to diminish in the wealthy countries In Northern Europe a number of countries had eliminated smallpox by  and by  the incidence in most industrialized countries had decreased to comparatively low levels
Vaccination continued in industrialized countries as protection against reintroduction until the mid to late s Australia and New Zealand are two notable exceptions neither experienced endemic smallpox and never vaccinated widely relying instead on protection by distance and strict quarantines
The first hemispherewide effort to eradicate smallpox was made in  by the Pan American Health Organization The campaign was successful in eliminating smallpox from all countries of the Americas except Argentina Brazil Colombia and Ecuador In  Professor Viktor Zhdanov Deputy Minister of Health for the USSR called on the World Health Assembly to undertake a global initiative to eradicate smallpox The proposal Resolution WHA was accepted in  At this point  million people were dying from smallpox every year Overall the progress towards eradication was disappointing especially in Africa and in the Indian subcontinent In  an international team the Smallpox Eradication Unit was formed under the leadership of an American Donald Henderson In  the World Health Organization intensified the global smallpox eradication by contributing  million annually to the effort and adopted the new disease surveillance method promoted by Czech epidemiologist Karel Raška
In the early s an estimated  million cases of smallpox occurred in the world each year To eradicate smallpox each outbreak had to be stopped from spreading by isolation of cases and vaccination of everyone who lived close by This process is known as "ring vaccination" The key to this strategy was the monitoring of cases in a community known as surveillance and containment
The initial problem the WHO team faced was inadequate reporting of smallpox cases as many cases did not come to the attention of the authorities The fact that humans are the only reservoir for smallpox infection and that carriers did not exist played a significant role in the eradication of smallpox The WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities Early on donations of vaccine were provided primarily by the Soviet Union and the United States but by  more than  percent of all vaccine was produced in developing countries The Soviet Union provided one and a half billion doses between  and  as well as the medical staff
The last major European outbreak of smallpox was in  in Yugoslavia after a pilgrim from Kosovo returned from the Middle East where he had contracted the virus The epidemic infected  people causing  deaths Authorities declared martial law enforced quarantine and undertook widespread revaccination of the population enlisting the help of the WHO In two months the outbreak was over Prior to this there had been a smallpox outbreak in May–July  in Stockholm Sweden brought from the Far East by a Swedish sailor this had been dealt with by quarantine measures and vaccination of the local population
By the end of  smallpox persisted only in the Horn of Africa Conditions were very difficult in Ethiopia and Somalia where there were few roads Civil war famine and refugees made the task even more difficult An intensive surveillance and containment and vaccination program was undertaken in these countries in early and mid under the direction of Australian microbiologist Frank Fenner As the campaign neared its goal Fenner and his team played an important role in verifying eradication The last naturally occurring case of indigenous smallpox Variola minor was diagnosed in Ali Maow Maalin a hospital cook in Merca Somalia on  October  The last naturally occurring case of the more deadly Variola major had been detected in October  in a threeyearold Bangladeshi girl Rahima Banu
The global eradication of smallpox was certified based on intense verification activities by a commission of eminent scientists on  December  and subsequently endorsed by the World Health Assembly on  May  The first two sentences of the resolution read
Having considered the development and results of the global program on smallpox eradication initiated by WHO in  and intensified since   Declares solemnly that the world and its peoples have won freedom from smallpox which was a most devastating disease sweeping in epidemic form through many countries since earliest time leaving death blindness and disfigurement in its wake and which only a decade ago was rampant in Africa Asia and South AmericaThe cost of the eradication effort from  to  was roughly US million Roughly a third came from the developed world which had largely eradicated smallpox decades earlier The United States the largest contributor to the program has reportedly recouped that investment every  days since in money not spent on vaccinations and the costs of incidence
The last case of smallpox in the world occurred in an outbreak in the United Kingdom in  A medical photographer Janet Parker contracted the disease at the University of Birmingham Medical School and died on  September  Although it has remained unclear how Parker became infected the source of the infection was established to be the smallpox virus grown for research purposes at the Medical School laboratory All known stocks of smallpox worldwide were subsequently destroyed or transferred to two WHOdesignated reference laboratories with BSL facilities – the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and the Soviet Unions now Russias State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR
WHO first recommended destruction of the virus in  and later set the date of destruction to be  December  This was postponed to  June  Due to resistance from the US and Russia in  the World Health Assembly agreed to permit the temporary retention of the virus stocks for specific research purposes Destroying existing stocks would reduce the risk involved with ongoing smallpox research the stocks are not needed to respond to a smallpox outbreak Some scientists have argued that the stocks may be useful in developing new vaccines antiviral drugs and diagnostic tests a  review by a team of public health experts appointed by WHO concluded that no essential public health purpose is served by the US and Russia continuing to retain virus stocks The latter view is frequently supported in the scientific community particularly among veterans of the WHO Smallpox Eradication Program
On March   smallpox scabs were found inside an envelope in an  book on Civil War medicine in Santa Fe New Mexico The envelope was labeled as containing scabs from a vaccination and gave scientists at the CDC an opportunity to study the history of smallpox vaccination in the United States
On July   six sealed glass vials of smallpox dated  along with sample vials of other pathogens were discovered in a cold storage room in an FDA laboratory at the National Institutes of Health location in Bethesda Maryland The smallpox vials were subsequently transferred to the custody of the CDC in Atlanta where virus taken from at least two vials proved viable in culture After studies were conducted the CDC destroyed the virus under WHO observation on February  
In  Canadian scientists recreated an extinct horse pox virus to demonstrate that the smallpox virus can be recreated in a small lab at a cost of about  by a team of scientists without specialist knowledge This makes the retention controversy irrelevant since the virus can be easily recreated even if all samples are destroyed Although the scientists performed the research to help development of new vaccines as well as trace smallpoxs history the possibility of the techniques being used for nefarious purposes was immediately recognized raising questions on dual use research and regulations
In September  the Russian lab housing smallpox samples experienced a gas explosion that injured one worker It did not occur near the virus storage area and no samples were compromised but the incident prompted a review of risks to containment
In  Pontiacs War broke out as a Native American confederacy led by Pontiac attempted to counter British control over the Great Lakes region A group of Native American warriors laid siege to Britishheld Fort Pitt on June  In response Henry Bouquet the commander of the fort ordered his subordinate Simeon Ecuyer to give smallpoxinfested blankets from the infirmary to a Delaware delegation outside the fort Bouquet had discussed this with his superior Sir Jeffrey Amherst who wrote to Bouquet stating "Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among the disaffected tribes of Indians We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them" Bouquet agreed with the proposal writing back that "I will try to inocculate  sic the Indians by means of Blankets that may fall in their hands" On  June  William Trent a local trader and commander of the Fort Pitt militia wrote "Out of our regard for them we gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital I hope it will have the desired effect" The effectiveness of this effort to broadcast the disease is unknown There are also accounts that smallpox was used as a weapon during the American Revolutionary War –
According to a theory put forward in Journal of Australian Studies JAS by independent researcher Christopher Warren Royal Marines used smallpox in  against indigenous tribes in New South Wales This theory was also considered earlier in Bulletin of the History of Medicine and by David Day However it is disputed by some medical academics including Professor Jack Carmody who in  claimed that the rapid spread of the outbreak in question was more likely indicative of chickenpoxa more infectious disease which at the time was often confused even by surgeons with smallpox and may have been comparably deadly to Aborigines and other peoples without natural immunity to it Carmody noted that in the month voyage of the First Fleet and the following  months there were no reports of smallpox amongst the colonists and that since smallpox has an incubation period of – days it is unlikely it was present in the First Fleet however Warren argued in the JAS article that the likely source was bottles of smallpox virus possessed by First Fleet surgeons Ian and Jennifer Glynn in The life and death of smallpox confirm that bottles of "variolous matter" were carried to Australia for use as a vaccine but think it unlikely the virus could have survived till  In  Christopher Warren offered evidence that the British smallpox may have been still viable However the only nonAborigine reported to have died in this outbreak was a seaman called Joseph Jeffries who was recorded as being of "American Indian" origin
W S Carus an expert in biological weapons has written that there is circumstantial evidence that smallpox was deliberately introduced to the Aboriginal population However Carmody and the Australian National Universitys Boyd Hunter continue to support the chickenpox hypothesis In a  lecture at the Australian National University Carmody pointed out that chickenpox unlike smallpox was known to be present in the Sydney Cove colony He also suggested that all c th century and earlier identifications of smallpox outbreaks were dubious because "surgeons  would have been unaware of the distinction between smallpox and chickenpox – the latter having traditionally been considered a milder form of smallpox"
During World War II scientists from the United Kingdom United States and Japan Unit  of the Imperial Japanese Army were involved in research into producing a biological weapon from smallpox Plans of large scale production were never carried through as they considered that the weapon would not be very effective due to the widescale availability of a vaccine
In  the Soviet Union established a smallpox weapons factory in the city of Zagorsk  km to the northeast of Moscow An outbreak of weaponized smallpox occurred during testing at a facility on an island in the Aral Sea in  General Prof Peter Burgasov former Chief Sanitary Physician of the Soviet Army and a senior researcher within the Soviet program of biological weapons described the incident
On Vozrozhdeniya Island in the Aral Sea the strongest recipes of smallpox were tested Suddenly I was informed that there were mysterious cases of mortalities in Aralsk A research ship of the Aral fleet came to within  km of the island it was forbidden to come any closer than  km The lab technician of this ship took samples of plankton twice a day from the top deck The smallpox formulation –  gr of which was exploded on the island – "got her" and she became infected After returning home to Aralsk she infected several people including children All of them died I suspected the reason for this and called the Chief of General Staff of the Ministry of Defense and requested to forbid the stop of the AlmaAta–Moscow train in Aralsk As a result the epidemic around the country was prevented I called Andropov who at that time was Chief of KGB and informed him of the exclusive recipe of smallpox obtained on Vozrazhdenie IslandOthers contend that the first patient may have contracted the disease while visiting Uyaly or KomsomolskonUstyurt two cities where the boat docked
Responding to international pressures in  the Soviet government allowed a joint US–British inspection team to tour four of its main weapons facilities at Biopreparat The inspectors were met with evasion and denials from the Soviet scientists and were eventually ordered out of the facility In  Soviet defector Ken Alibek alleged that the Soviet bioweapons program at Zagorsk had produced a large stockpile – as much as twenty tons – of weaponized smallpox possibly engineered to resist vaccines Alibek further alleged along with refrigerated warheads to deliver it Alibeks stories about the former Soviet programs smallpox activities have never been independently verified
In  the Russian government announced that all of its remaining smallpox samples would be moved to the Vector Institute in Koltsovo With the breakup of the Soviet Union and unemployment of many of the weapons programs scientists US government officials have expressed concern that smallpox and the expertise to weaponize it may have become available to other governments or terrorist groups who might wish to use virus as means of biological warfare Specific allegations made against Iraq in this respect proved to be false
Concern has been expressed by some that artificial gene synthesis could be used to recreate the virus from existing digital genomes for use in biological warfare Insertion of the synthesized smallpox DNA into existing related pox viruses could theoretically be used to recreate the virus The first step to mitigating this risk it has been suggested should be to destroy the remaining virus stocks to enable unequivocal criminalization of any possession of the virus
Famous historical figures who contracted smallpox include Lakota Chief Sitting Bull Ramses V the Kangxi Emperor survived Shunzhi Emperor and Tongzhi Emperor of China Emperor Komei of Japan died of smallpox in  and Date Masamune of Japan who lost an eye to the disease Cuitláhuac the th tlatoani ruler of the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan died of smallpox in  shortly after its introduction to the Americas and the Incan emperor Huayna Capac died of it in  causing a civil war of succession in the Inca empire and the eventual conquest by the Spaniards More recent public figures include Guru Har Krishan th Guru of the Sikhs in  Louis I of Spain in  died Peter II of Russia in  died George Washington survived Louis XV of France in  died and Maximilian III Joseph of Bavaria in  died
Prominent families throughout the world often had several people infected by andor perish from the disease For example several relatives of Henry VIII of England survived the disease but were scarred by it These include his sister Margaret his wife Anne of Cleves and his two daughters Mary I in  and Elizabeth I in  Elizabeth tried to disguise the pockmarks with heavy makeup Mary Queen of Scots contracted the disease as a child but had no visible scarring
In Europe deaths from smallpox often changed dynastic succession Louis XV of France succeeded his greatgrandfather Louis XIV through a series of deaths of smallpox or measles among those higher in the succession line He himself died of the disease in  Peter II of Russia died of the disease at  years of age Also before becoming emperor Peter III of Russia caught the virus and suffered greatly from it He was left scarred and disfigured His wife Catherine the Great was spared but fear of the virus clearly had its effects on her She feared for the safety of her son Paul so much that she made sure that large crowds were kept at bay and sought to isolate him Eventually she decided to have herself inoculated by a British doctor Thomas Dimsdale While this was considered a controversial method at the time she succeeded Paul was later inoculated as well Catherine then sought to have inoculations throughout her empire stating "My objective was through my example to save from death the multitude of my subjects who not knowing the value of this technique and frightened of it were left in danger" By  approximately  million inoculations were administered in the Russian Empire
In China the Qing dynasty had extensive protocols to protect Manchus from Pekings endemic smallpox
US Presidents George Washington Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln all contracted and recovered from the disease Washington became infected with smallpox on a visit to Barbados in  Jackson developed the illness after being taken prisoner by the British during the American Revolution and though he recovered his brother Robert did not Lincoln contracted the disease during his presidency possibly from his son Tad and was quarantined shortly after giving the Gettysburg address in 
Famous theologian Jonathan Edwards died of smallpox in  following an inoculation
Soviet leader Joseph Stalin fell ill with smallpox at the age of seven His face was badly scarred by the disease He later had photographs retouched to make his pockmarks less apparent
Hungarian poet Ferenc Kölcsey who wrote the Hungarian national anthem lost his right eye to smallpox
In the face of the devastation of smallpox various smallpox gods and goddesses have been worshipped throughout parts of the Old World for example in China and India In China the smallpox goddess was referred to as TouShen NiangNiang Chinese 痘疹娘娘 Chinese believers actively worked to appease the goddess and pray for her mercy by such measures as referring to smallpox pustules as "beautiful flowers" as a euphemism intended to avert offending the goddess for example the Chinese word for smallpox is 天花 literally "heaven flower" In a related New Years Eve custom it was prescribed that the children of the house wear ugly masks while sleeping so as to conceal any beauty and thereby avoid attracting the goddess who would be passing through sometime that night If a case of smallpox did occur shrines would be set up in the homes of the victims to be worshipped and offered to as the disease ran its course If the victim recovered the shrines were removed and carried away in a special paper chair or boat for burning If the patient did not recover the shrine was destroyed and cursed to expel the goddess from the house
In the Yoruba language smallpox is known as ṣọpọná but it was also written as shakpanna shopona ṣhapana and ṣọpọnọ The word is a combination of  words the verb ṣán meaning to cover or plaster referring to the pustules characteristic of smallpox kpa or pa meaning to kill and enia meaning human Roughly translated it means One who kills a person by covering them with pustules Among the Yorùbá people of West Africa and also in Dahomean religion Trinidad and in Brazil The deity Sopona also known as Obaluaye is the deity of smallpox and other deadly diseases like leprosy HIVAIDS and fevers One of the most feared deities of the orisha pantheon smallpox was seen as a form of punishment from Shopona Worship of Shopona was highly controlled by his priests and it was believed that priests could also spread smallpox when angered However Shopona was also seen as a healer who could cure the diseases he inflicted and he was often called upon his victims to heal them The British government banned the worship of the god because it was believed his priests were purposely spreading smallpox to their opponents
Indias first records of smallpox can be found in a medical book that dates back to  CE This book describes a disease that sounds exceptionally like smallpox India like China and the Yorùbá created a goddess in response to its exposure to smallpox The Hindu goddess Shitala was both worshipped and feared during her reign It was believed that this goddess was both evil and kind and had the ability to inflict victims when angered as well as calm the fevers of the already afflicted Portraits of the goddess show her holding a broom in her right hand to continue to move the disease and a pot of cool water in the other hand in an attempt to soothe victims Shrines were created where many Indian natives both healthy and not went to worship and attempt to protect themselves from this disease Some Indian women in an attempt to ward off Shitala placed plates of cooling foods and pots of water on the roofs of their homes
In cultures that did not recognize a smallpox deity there was often nonetheless a belief in smallpox demons who were accordingly blamed for the disease Such beliefs were prominent in Japan Europe Africa and other parts of the world Nearly all cultures who believed in the demon also believed that it was afraid of the color red This led to the invention of the socalled red treatment where victims and their rooms would be decorated in red The practice spread to Europe in the th century and was practiced by among others Charles V of France and Elizabeth I of England Afforded scientific credibility through the studies by Niels Ryberg Finsen showing that red light reduced scarring this belief persisted even until the s
