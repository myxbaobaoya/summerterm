Japanese encephalitis JE is an infection of the brain caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus JEV While most infections result in little or no symptoms occasional inflammation of the brain occurs In these cases symptoms may include headache vomiting fever confusion and seizures This occurs about  to  days after infection
JEV is generally spread by mosquitoes specifically those of the Culex type Pigs and wild birds serve as a reservoir for the virus The disease occurs mostly outside of cities Diagnosis is based on blood or cerebrospinal fluid testing
Prevention is generally with the Japanese encephalitis vaccine which is both safe and effective Other measures include avoiding mosquito bites Once infected there is no specific treatment with care being supportive This is generally carried out in a hospital Permanent problems occur in up to half of people who recover from JE
The disease primarily occurs in East and Southeast Asia as well as the Western Pacific About  billion people live in areas where the disease occurs About  symptomatic cases occur a year with about  deaths Often cases occur in outbreaks The disease was first described in Japan in 
The Japanese encephalitis virus JEV has an incubation period of  to  days The vast majority of infections are asymptomatic only  in  infections develop into encephalitis
Severe rigors may mark the onset of this disease in humans Fever headache and malaise are other nonspecific symptoms of this disease which may last for a period of between  and  days Signs which develop during the acute encephalitic stage include neck rigidity cachexia hemiparesis convulsions and a raised body temperature between – °C – °F Mental retardation is usually developed Mortality of this disease varies but is generally higher in children Transplacental spread has been noted Lifelong neurological defects such as deafness emotional lability and hemiparesis may occur in those who have had central nervous system involvement In known cases some effects also include nausea headache fever and vomitingcitation needed
Increased microglial activation following Japanese encephalitis infection has been found to influence the outcome of viral pathogenesis Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system CNS and have a critical role in host defense against invading microorganisms Activated microglia secrete cytokines such as interleukin IL and tumor necrosis factor alpha TNFα which can cause toxic effects in the brain Additionally other soluble factors such as neurotoxins excitatory neurotransmitters prostaglandin reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are secreted by activated microgliacitation needed
In a murine model of JE it was found that in the hippocampus and the striatum the number of activated microglia was more than anywhere else in the brain closely followed by that in the thalamus In the cortex the number of activated microglia was significantly less when compared to other regions of the mouse brain An overall induction of differential expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines from different brain regions during a progressive Japanese encephalitis infection was also observedcitation needed
Although the net effect of the proinflammatory mediators is to kill infectious organisms and infected cells as well as to stimulate the production of molecules that amplify the mounting response to damage it is also evident that in a nonregenerating organ such as the brain a dysregulated innate immune response would be deleterious In JE the tight regulation of microglial activation appears to be disturbed resulting in an autotoxic loop of microglial activation that possibly leads to bystander neuronal damage In animals key signs include infertility and abortion in pigs neurological disease in horses and systemic signs including fever lethargy and anorexia
It is a disease caused by the mosquitoborne Japanese encephalitis virus JEV
JEV is a virus from the family Flaviviridae part of the Japanese encephalitis serocomplex of  genetically and antigenically related viruses some which are particularly severe in horses and four known to infect humans including West Nile virus The enveloped virus is closely related to the West Nile virus and the St Louis encephalitis virus The positive sense singlestranded RNA genome is packaged in the capsid which is formed by the capsid protein The outer envelope is formed by envelope protein and is the protective antigen It aids in entry of the virus into the cell The genome also encodes several nonstructural proteins NS NSa NSb NS Na NSb NS NS is produced as a secretory form also NS is a putative helicase and NS is the viral polymerase It has been noted that Japanese encephalitis infects the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum ER and rapidly accumulates substantial amounts of viral proteins
Based on the envelope gene there are five genotypes I–V The Muar strain isolated from a patient in Malaya in  is the prototype strain of genotype V Genotype IV appears to be the ancestral strain and the virus may have evolved in the Malay Archipelagocitation needed The first clinical reports date from  but the virus appears to have evolved in the midth century Over sixty complete genomes of this virus had been sequenced by citation needed
Japanese encephalitis is diagnosed by commercially available tests detecting JE virusspecific IgM antibodies in serum andor cerebrospinal fluid for example by IgM capture ELISA
JE virus IgM antibodies are usually detectable  to  days after onset of illness and persist for  to  days but longer persistence has been documented Therefore positive IgM antibodies occasionally may reflect a past infection or vaccination Serum collected within  days of illness onset may not have detectable IgM and the test should be repeated on a convalescent sample For patients with JE virus IgM antibodies confirmatory neutralizing antibody testing should be performedcitation needed
Confirmatory testing in the US is available only at the CDC and a few specialized reference laboratories In fatal cases nucleic acid amplification and virus culture of autopsy tissues can be useful Viral antigen can be shown in tissues by indirect fluorescent antibody staining
Infection with Japanese encephalitis confers lifelong immunity There are currently three vaccines available SA IXIARO IC also marketed in Australia New Zealand as JESPECT and India as JEEV and ChimeriVaxJE marketed as IMOJEV All current vaccines are based on the genotype III viruscitation needed
A formalininactivated mousebrainderived vaccine was first produced in Japan in the s and was validated for use in Taiwan in the s and in Thailand in the s  The widespread use of vaccine and urbanization has led to control of the disease in Japan and Singapore The high cost of this vaccine which is grown in live mice means that poorer countries have not been able to afford to give it as part of a routine immunization program
The most common adverse effects are redness and pain at the injection site  Uncommonly an urticarial reaction can develop about four days after injection Vaccines produced from mouse brain have a risk of autoimmune neurological complications of around  per million vaccinations However where the vaccine is not produced in mouse brains but in vitro using cell culture there are few adverse effects compared to placebo the main side effects being headache and myalgia
The neutralizing antibody persists in the circulation for at least two to three years and perhaps longer  The total duration of protection is unknown but because there is no firm evidence for protection beyond three years boosters are recommended every three years for people who remain at risk Furthermore there are no data available regarding the interchangeability of other JE vaccines and IXIARO
There is no specific treatment for Japanese encephalitis and treatment is supportive with assistance given for feeding breathing or seizure control as required Raised intracranial pressure may be managed with mannitol  There is no transmission from person to person and therefore patients do not need to be isolatedcitation needed
A breakthrough in the field of Japanese encephalitis therapeutics is the identification of macrophage receptor involvement in the disease severity A recent report of an Indian group demonstrates the involvement of monocyte and macrophage receptor CLECA in severe inflammatory response in Japanese encephalitis infection of the brain This transcriptomic study provides a hypothesis of neuroinflammation and a new lead in development of appropriate therapies for Japanese encephalitis
The effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin for the management of encephalitis is unclear due to a lack of evidence Intravenous immunoglobulin for Japanese encephalitis appeared to have no benefit
Japanese encephalitis JE is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia with up to  cases reported annually Casefatality rates range from  to  and depend on the population and age Rare outbreaks in US territories in the Western Pacific have also occurred Residents of rural areas in endemic locations are at highest risk Japanese encephalitis does not usually occur in urban areascitation needed
Countries which have had major epidemics in the past but which have controlled the disease primarily by vaccination include China South Korea Singapore Japan Taiwan and Thailand Other countries that still have periodic epidemics include Vietnam Cambodia Myanmar India Nepal and Malaysia Japanese encephalitis has been reported in the Torres Strait Islands and two fatal cases were reported in mainland northern Australia in  There were reported cases in Kachin State Myanmar in  
The spread of the virus in Australia is of particular concern to Australian health officials due to the unplanned introduction of Culex gelidus a potential vector of the virus In February  Japanese encephalitis was detected and confirmed in piggeries in Victoria Queensland and New South Wales On  March cases were detected in South Australia However the current presence on mainland Australia is minimal except in the northern areas There were  deaths reported in Odishas backward Malkangiri district of India in citation needed
Human cattle and horses are deadend hosts as the disease manifests as fatal encephalitis  Pigs act as an amplifying host and have a very important role in the epidemiology of the disease  Infection in swine is asymptomatic except in pregnant sows when abortion and fetal abnormalities are common sequelae The most important vector is Culex tritaeniorhynchus which feeds on cattle in preference to humans The natural hosts of the Japanese encephalitis virus are birds not humans and many believe the virus will therefore never be completely eliminated  In November  the Japanese encephalitis virus was reported in Culex bitaeniorhynchus in South Korea
Recently whole genome microarray research of neurons infected with the Japanese encephalitis virus has shown that neurons play an important role in their own defense against Japanese encephalitis infection Although this challenges the longheld belief that neurons are immunologically quiescent an improved understanding of the proinflammatory effects responsible for immunemediated control of viral infection and neuronal injury during Japanese encephalitis infection is an essential step for developing strategies for limiting the severity of CNS disease
A number of drugs have been investigated to either reduce viral replication or provide neuroprotection in cell lines or studies upon mice None are currently advocated in treating human patients
It is theorized that the virus may have originated from an ancestral virus in the mids in the Malay Archipelago region and evolved there into five different genotypes which spread across Asia The mean evolutionary rate has been estimated to be ×− range ×− to ×− nucleotide substitutions per site per year
