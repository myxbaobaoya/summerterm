Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus is a mosquitoborne viral pathogen that causes Venezuelan equine encephalitis or encephalomyelitis VEE VEE can affect all equine species such as horses donkeys and zebras After infection equines may suddenly die or show progressive central nervous system disorders Humans also can contract this disease Healthy adults who become infected by the virus may experience flulike symptoms such as high fevers and headaches People with weakened immune systems and the young and the elderly can become severely ill or die from this disease
The virus that causes VEE is transmitted primarily by mosquitoes that bite an infected animal and then bite and feed on another animal or human The speed with which the disease spreads depends on the subtype of the VEE virus and the density of mosquito populations Enzootic subtypes of VEE are diseases endemic to certain areas Generally these serotypes do not spread to other localities Enzootic subtypes are associated with the rodentmosquito transmission cycle These forms of the virus can cause human illness but generally do not affect equine health
Epizootic subtypes on the other hand can spread rapidly through large populations These forms of the virus are highly pathogenic to equines and can also affect human health Equines rather than rodents are the primary animal species that carry and spread the disease Infected equines develop an enormous quantity of virus in their circulatory system When a bloodfeeding insect feeds on such animals it picks up this virus and transmits it to other animals or humans Although other animals such as cattle swine and dogs can become infected they generally do not show signs of the disease or contribute to its spread
The virion is spherical and approximately  nm in diameter It has a lipid membrane with glycoprotein surface proteins spread around the outside Surrounding the nuclear material is a nucleocapsid that has an icosahedral symmetry of T   and is approximately  nm in diameter
Serology testing performed on this virus has shown the presence of six different subtypes classified I to VI  These have been given names including Mucambo Tonate and Pixuna subtypes There are seven different variants in subtype I and three of these variants A B and C are the epizootic strainscitation needed
The Mucambo virus subtype III appears to have evolved  AD  credible interval – In Venezuela the Mucambo subtype was identified in  by Jose Esparza and J Sánchez using cultured mosquito cells
In the Americas there have been  reported outbreaks of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus Outbreaks of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus occurred in Central American and South American countries  This virus was isolated in  and outbreaks have been reported in many different countries since then  Mexico Colombia Venezuela and the United States are just some of the countries that have reported outbreaks Outbreaks of VEE generally occur after periods of heavy precipitation that cause mosquito populations to thrive
Between December  and January  the Venezuelan state of Trujillo experienced an outbreak of this virus  Overall  cases of the disease were reported along with  deaths
June  saw a bigger outbreak in the Venezuelan state of Zulia as  humans died as well as  equine deaths
A much larger outbreak in Venezuela and Colombia occurred in   On May   equine encephalitislike cases were reported in the northwest portion of the country  Eventually the outbreak spread more towards the north as well as to the south  The outbreak caused about  febrile cases in humans as well as  deaths  About  equine cases were reported with  deaths
An outbreak of this disease occurred in Colombia on September   This outbreak resulted in  human cases that were attributable to Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus with  human deaths A possible explanation for the serious outbreaks was the particularly heavy rain that had fallen  This could have caused increased numbers of mosquitoes that could serve as vectors for the disease A more likely explanation is that deforestation caused a change in mosquito species Culex taenopius mosquitos which prefer rodents were replaced by Aedes taeniorhynchus mosquitoes which are more likely to bite humans and large equinescitation needed
Though the majority of VEE outbreaks occur in Central and South America the virus has potential to outbreak again in the United States It has been shown the invasive mosquito species Aedes albopictus is a viable carrier of VEEV
There is an inactivated vaccine containing the C strain for VEEV that is used to immunize horses Another vaccine containing the TC strain is only used on humans in military and laboratory positions that risk contracting the virus The human vaccine can result in side effects and does not fully immunize the patient The TC strain was generated by passing the virus  times through a guinea pig heart cell culture C is a derivative of TC
In April  the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick reported that samples of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus were discovered missing during an inventory of a group of samples left by a departed researcher The report stated the samples were likely among those destroyed when a freezer malfunctioned
During the Cold War both the United States biological weapons program and the Soviet biological weapons program researched and weaponized VEE In his book Biohazard The Chilling True Story of the Largest Covert Biological Weapons Program in the World author Stephen Handelman details the weaponization of VEE and other biologicals including plague anthrax and smallpox by Dr Ken Alibek in the Cold War Soviet weapons programscitation needed
