Human metapneumovirus HMPV is a negativesense singlestranded RNA virus of the family Pneumoviridae and is closely related to the Avian metapneumovirus AMPV subgroup C It was isolated for the first time in  in the Netherlands by using the RAPPCR RNA arbitrarily primed PCR technique for identification of unknown viruses growing in cultured cells It is the second most common cause after Respiratory syncytial virus RSV of lower respiratory infection in young childrencitation needed
The peak age of hospitalization for infants with HMPV occurs between – months of age slightly older than the peak of RSV which is around – months The clinical features and severity of HMPV are similar to those of RSV HMPV is also an important cause of disease in older adults
HMPV is associated with  to  of respiratory tract infections in hospitalized and outpatient children The virus is distributed worldwide and in temperate regions has a seasonal distribution generally following that of RSV and influenza virus during late winter and spring Serologic studies have shown that by the age of five virtually all children worldwide have been exposed to the virus Despite near universal infection during early life reinfections are common in older children and adults Human metapneumovirus may cause mild upper respiratory tract infection the common cold However premature infants immunocompromised persons and older adults  years  are at risk for severe disease and hospitalization In some studies of hospitalizations and emergency room visits HMPV is nearly as common and as severe as influenza in older adults HMPV is associated with more severe disease in people with asthma  and adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD Numerous outbreaks of HMPV have been reported in longterm care facilities for children and adults causing fatalities
The genomic organisation of HMPV is similar to RSV however HMPV lacks the nonstructural genes NS and NS and the HMPV antisense RNA genome contains eight open reading frames in slightly different gene order than RSV viz NPMFMSHGL HMPV is genetically similar to the avian metapneumoviruses A B and in particular type C Phylogenetic analysis of HMPV has demonstrated the existence of two main genetic lineages termed subtype A and B containing within them the subgroups AA and BB respectively Genotyping based on sequences of the F and G genes showed that subtype B was associated with increased cough duration and increased general respiratory systems compared to HMPVA
HMPV infects airway epithelial cells in the nose and lung HMPV is thought to attach to the target cell via the glycoprotein G protein interactions with heparan sulfate and other glycosaminoglycans The HMPV fusion F protein encodes an RGD ArgGlyAsp motif that engages RGDbinding integrins as cellular receptors then mediates fusion of the cell membrane and viral envelope in a pHindependent fashion likely within endosomes
The identification of HMPV has predominantly relied on reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction RTPCR technology to amplify directly from RNA extracted from respiratory specimens Alternative more costeffective approaches to the detection of HMPV by nucleic acidbased approaches have been employed and these include
There are no conclusive studies to date however it is likely that transmission occurs by contact with contaminated secretions via droplet aerosol or fomite vectors  Hospital acquired infections with human metapneumovirus have been reported HMPV has been shown to circulate during fall and winter months with alternating predominance of a single subtype each year
No treatment is yet known but ribavirin has shown effectiveness in an animal model
American pharmaceutical corporation Moderna has conducted a clinical trial for a candidate modRNA vaccine against metapneumovirus As of October  the vaccine candidate has passed through phase I with reports that the vaccine is welltolerated at all dose levels at two months and provokes an immune response which boosts the production of neutralising antibodies
Human metapneumovirus was first reported in  and avian metapneumovirus in the s There are at least four lineages of human metapneumovirusA A B and B Avian metapneumovirus has been divided into four subgroupsA B C and D Bayesian estimates suggest that human metapneumovirus emerged – years ago and diverged from avian metapneumovirus around
