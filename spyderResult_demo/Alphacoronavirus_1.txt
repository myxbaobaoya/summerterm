Alphacoronavirus  is a species of coronavirus that infects cats dogs and pigs It includes the virus strains feline coronavirus canine coronavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus It is an enveloped positivestrand RNA virus which is able to enter its host cell by binding to the APN receptor
Member viruses were first recognised as viruses that caused transmissible gastroenteritis in pigs in  It was originally named porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus in  After subsequent discovery of canine coronavirus in dogs and feline coronavirus in cats the three virus species were merged into a single species in  The strain canine coronavirusHuPn has been identified in a small number of human cases
In the mids there was an outbreak of pig disease in US called transmissible gastroenteritis which was characterised mainly by diarrhoea and vomiting It was suspected to be a viral infection and was highly fatal among young pigs Leo P Doyle and L M Hutchings reported the case in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association in  The virus was identified and isolated by A W McClurkin in  The International Committee for the Nomenclature of Viruses ICNV later renamed International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ICTV in  accepted the scientific named Transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine in its first report in  but renamed it Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus PTGV in its second report in 
There was another case of coronavirus infection in cats in  The virus caused inflammation of the abdomen peritonitis and was highly fatal The virus was identified in  and was named as Feline infectious peritonitis virus by ICTV in  It was again renamed Feline coronavirus in  In  there was an outbreak of viral infection among US military dogs The virus was identified as a coronavirus and the formal name Canine coronavirus was adopted by ICTV in  As the molecular and antigenic relationship of the three viruses were later established in the late s ICTV merged them into a single species Alphacoronavirus  in
