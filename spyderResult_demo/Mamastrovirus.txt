Mamastrovirus is a genus of viruses in the family Astroviridae Human mammals and vertebrates serve as natural hosts There are  species in this genus Diseases associated with this genus include infantile gastroenteritis
The genus contains the following species
Viruses in Mamastrovirus are nonenveloped with icosahedral and spherical geometries and T symmetry The diameter is around Â nm Genomes are linear and nonsegmented around kb in length
Viral replication is cytoplasmic Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment to host receptors which mediates endocytosis Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model Positive stranded RNA virus transcription using an unknown model of subgenomic RNA transcription is the method of transcription Translation takes place by  ribosomal frameshifting Human mammals and  vertebrates serve as the natural host Transmission routes are fecaloral
