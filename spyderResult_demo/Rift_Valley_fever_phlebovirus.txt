Rift Valley fever RVF is a viral disease of humans and livestock that can cause mild to severe symptoms The mild symptoms may include fever muscle pains and headaches which often last for up to a week The severe symptoms may include loss of sight beginning three weeks after the infection infections of the brain causing severe headaches and confusion and bleeding together with liver problems which may occur within the first few days Those who have bleeding have a chance of death as high as 
The disease is caused by the RVF virus It is spread by either touching infected animal blood breathing in the air around an infected animal being butchered drinking raw milk from an infected animal or the bite of infected mosquitoes Animals such as cows sheep goats and camels may be affected In these animals it is spread mostly by mosquitoes It does not appear that one person can infect another person The disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies against the virus or the virus itself in the blood
Prevention of the disease in humans is accomplished by vaccinating animals against the disease This must be done before an outbreak occurs because if it is done during an outbreak it may worsen the situation Stopping the movement of animals during an outbreak may also be useful as may decreasing mosquito numbers and avoiding their bites There is a human vaccine however as of  it is not widely available There is no specific treatment and medical efforts are supportive
Outbreaks of the disease have only occurred in Africa and Arabia Outbreaks usually occur during periods of increased rain which increase the number of mosquitoes The disease was first reported among livestock in Rift Valley of Kenya in the early s and the virus was first isolated in 
In humans the virus can cause several syndromes Usually sufferers have either no symptoms or only a mild illness with fever headache muscle pains and liver abnormalities In a small percentage of cases   the illness can progress to hemorrhagic fever syndrome meningoencephalitis inflammation of the brain and tissues lining the brain or affect the eye Patients who become ill usually experience fever generalised weakness back pain dizziness and weight loss at the onset of the illness Typically people recover within two to seven days after onset About  of people with the disease die of it In livestock the fatality level is significantly higher Pregnant livestock infected with RVF abort virtually  of foetuses An epizootic animal disease epidemic of RVF is usually first indicated by a wave of unexplained abortionscitation needed
Other signs in livestock include vomiting and diarrhoea respiratory disease fever lethargy anorexia and sudden death in young animals
The virus belongs to the Bunyavirales order This is an order of enveloped negative single stranded RNA viruses All Bunyaviruses have an outer lipid envelope with two glycoproteinsGN and GCrequired for cell entry They deliver their genome into the hostcell cytoplasm by fusing their envelope with an endosomal membranecitation needed
The virus GC protein has a class II membrane fusion protein architecture similar to that found in flaviviruses and alphaviruses This structural similarity suggests that there may be a common origin for these viral familiescitation needed
The virus  kb tripartite genome is composed of singlestranded RNA As a Phlebovirus it has an ambisense genome Its L and M segments are negativesense but its S segment is ambisense These three genome segments code for six major proteins L protein viral polymerase the two glycoproteins GN and GC the nucleocapsid N protein and the nonstructural NSs and NSm proteinscitation needed
The virus is transmitted through mosquito vectors as well as through contact with the tissue of infected animals Two speciesCulex tritaeniorhynchus and Aedes vexansare known to transmit the virus Other potential vectors include Aedes caspius Aedes mcintosh Aedes ochraceus Culex pipiens Culex antennatus Culex perexiguus Culex zombaensis and Culex quinquefasciatus Contact with infected tissue is considered to be the main source of human infections The virus has been isolated from two bat species the Peters epauletted fruit bat Micropteropus pusillus and the aba roundleaf bat Hipposideros abae which are believed to be reservoirs for the virus
Although many components of the RVFVs RNA play an important role in the virus pathology the nonstructural protein encoded on the S segment NSs is the only component that has been found to directly affect the host NSs is hostile and combative against the hosts interferon IFNs antiviral response IFNs are essential in order for the immune system to fight off viral infections in a host This inhibitory mechanism is believed to be due to a number of reasons the first being competitive inhibition of the formation of the transcription factor On this transcription factor NSs interacts with and binds to a subunit that is needed for RNA polymerase I and II This interaction cause competitive inhibition with another transcription factor component and prevents the assembly process of the transcription factor complex which results in the suppression of the host antiviral response Transcription suppression is believed to be another mechanism of this inhibitory process This occurs when an area of NSs interacts with and binds to the hosts protein SAP and forms a complex This complex causes histone acetylation to regress which is needed for transcriptional activation of the IFN promoter This causes IFN expression to be obstructed Lastly NSs has also been known to affect regular activity of doublestranded RNAdependent protein kinase R This protein is involved in cellular antiviral responses in the host When RVFV is able to enter the hosts DNA NSs forms a filamentous structure in the nucleus This allows the virus to interact with specific areas of the hosts DNA that relates to segregation defects and induction of chromosome continuity This increases host infectivity and decreases the hosts antiviral response
Diagnosis relies on viral isolation from tissues or serological testing with an ELISA Other methods of diagnosis include Nucleic Acid Testing NAT cell culture and IgM antibody assays As of September  the Kenya Medical Research Institute KEMRI has developed a product called Immunoline designed to diagnose the disease in humans much faster than in previous methods
A persons chances of becoming infected can be reduced by taking measures to decrease contact with blood body fluids or tissues of infected animals and protection against mosquitoes and other bloodsucking insects Use of mosquito repellents and bed nets are two effective methods For persons working with animals in RVFendemic areas wearing protective equipment to avoid any exposure to blood or tissues of animals that may potentially be infected is an important protective measure Potentially establishing environmental monitoring and case surveillance systems may aid in the prediction and control of future RVF outbreaks
No vaccines are currently available for humans While a vaccines have been developed for humans it has only been used experimentally for scientific personnel in highrisk environments Trials of a number of vaccines such as NDBR and TSIGSD  are ongoing Different types of vaccines for veterinary use are available The killed vaccines are not practical in routine animal field vaccination because of the need of multiple injections Live vaccines require a single injection but are known to cause birth defects and abortions in sheep and induce only lowlevel protection in cattle The liveattenuated vaccine MP has demonstrated promising results in laboratory trials in domesticated animals but more research is needed before the vaccine can be used in the field The liveattenuated clone  vaccine was recently registered and used in South Africa Alternative vaccines using molecular recombinant constructs are in development and show promising results
A vaccine has been conditionally approved for use in animals in the US It has been shown that knockout of the NSs and NSm nonstructural proteins of this virus produces an effective vaccine in sheep as well
RVF outbreaks occur across subSaharan Africa with outbreaks occurring elsewhere infrequently Outbreaks of this disease usually correspond with the warm phases of the EI NiñoSouthern Oscillation During this time there is an increase in rainfall flooding and greenness of vegetation index which leads to an increase in mosquito vectors RVFV can be transmitted vertically in mosquitos meaning that the virus can be passed from the mother to her offspring During dry conditions the virus can remain viable for a number of years in the egg Mosquitos lay their eggs in water where they eventually hatch As water is essential for mosquito eggs to hatch rainfall and flooding cause an increase in the mosquito population and an increased potential for the virus
The first documented outbreak was identified in Kenya in  in sheep cattle and humans another severe outbreak in the country in – involved  deaths in livestock and an unrecorded number of humans with fever An outbreak occurred in South Africa in – with more than  infected animals and the first deaths in humans In Egypt in – an estimated  people were infected and there were at least  deaths In Kenya in  the virus killed more than  peoplecitation needed Since then there have been outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and Yemen citation needed East Africa – Sudan  South Africa  Uganda  Kenya  and Mayotte – – in Kenya in  an outbreak is ongoing in Burundi
Rift Valley fever was one of more than a dozen agents that the United States researched as potential biological weapons before the nation suspended its biological weapons program in 
The disease is one of several identified by WHO as a likely cause of a future epidemic in a new plan developed after the Ebola epidemic for urgent research and development toward new diagnostic tests vaccines and medicines
