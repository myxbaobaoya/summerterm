Zaire ebolavirus more commonly known as Ebola virus iˈboʊlə ɪ EBOV is one of six known species within the genus Ebolavirus Four of the six known ebolaviruses including EBOV cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals known as Ebola virus disease EVD Ebola virus has caused the majority of human deaths from EVD and was the cause of the – epidemic in western Africa which resulted in at least  suspected cases and  confirmed deaths
Ebola virus and its genus were both originally named for Zaire now the Democratic Republic of the Congo the country where it was first described and was at first suspected to be a new "strain" of the closely related Marburg virus The virus was renamed "Ebola virus" in  to avoid confusion Ebola virus is the single member of the species Zaire ebolavirus which is assigned to the genus Ebolavirus family Filoviridae order Mononegavirales The members of the species are called Zaire ebolaviruses The natural reservoir of Ebola virus is believed to be bats particularly fruit bats and it is primarily transmitted between humans and from animals to humans through body fluids
The EBOV genome is a singlestranded RNA approximately  nucleotides long It encodes seven structural proteins nucleoprotein NP polymerase cofactor VP VP GP transcription activator VP VP and RNAdependent RNA polymerase L
Because of its high fatality rate up to  to  percent EBOV is also listed as a select agent World Health Organization Risk Group  Pathogen requiring Biosafety Level equivalent containment a US National Institutes of HealthNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Category A Priority Pathogen US CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Category A Bioterrorism Agent and a Biological Agent for Export Control by the Australia Groupcitation needed
EBOV carries a negativesense RNA genome in virions that are cylindricaltubular and contain viral envelope matrix and nucleocapsid components The overall cylinders are generally approximately  nm in diameter and have a virally encoded glycoprotein GP projecting as – nm long spikes from its lipid bilayer surface The cylinders are of variable length typically  nm but sometimes up to  nm long The outer viral envelope of the virion is derived by budding from domains of host cell membrane into which the GP spikes have been inserted during their biosynthesis Individual GP molecules appear with spacings of about  nm Viral proteins VP and VP are located between the envelope and the nucleocapsid see following in the matrix space At the center of the virion structure is the nucleocapsid which is composed of a series of viral proteins attached to an – kb linear negativesense RNA without ′polyadenylation or ′capping see following the RNA is helically wound and complexed with the NP VP VP and L proteins this helix has a diameter of  nm
The overall shape of the virions after purification and visualization eg by ultracentrifugation and electron microscopy respectively varies considerably simple cylinders are far less prevalent than structures showing reversed direction branches and loops eg U shepherds crook  or eye boltshapes or other or circularcoiled appearances the origin of which may be in the laboratory techniques applied The characteristic "threadlike" structure is however a more general morphologic characteristic of filoviruses alongside their GPdecorated viral envelope RNA nucleocapsid etc
Each virion contains one molecule of linear singlestranded negativesense RNA  to  nucleotides in length The ′ terminus is not polyadenylated and the ′ end is not capped This viral genome codes for seven structural proteins and one nonstructural protein The gene order is ′ – leader – NP – VP – VP – GPsGP – VP – VP – L – trailer – ′ with the leader and trailer being nontranscribed regions which carry important signals to control transcription replication and packaging of the viral genomes into new virions Sections of the NP VP and the L genes from filoviruses have been identified as endogenous in the genomes of several groups of small mammals

It was found that  nucleotides from the  end and  nucleotides from the  end are sufficient for replication of a viral "minigenome" though not sufficient for infection Virus sequencing from  patients with confirmed Ebola virus disease representing more than  of cases diagnosed in Sierra Leone from late May to midJune  provided evidence that the  outbreak was no longer being fed by new contacts with its natural reservoir Using thirdgeneration sequencing technology investigators were able to sequence samples as quickly as  hours Like other RNA viruses Ebola virus mutates rapidly both within a person during the progression of disease and in the reservoir among the local human population The observed mutation rate of  x − substitutions per site per year is as fast as that of seasonal influenza
There are two candidates for host cell entry proteins The first is a cholesterol transporter protein the hostencoded Niemann–Pick C NPC which appears to be essential for entry of Ebola virions into the host cell and for its ultimate replication In one study mice with one copy of the NPC gene removed showed an  percent survival rate fifteen days after exposure to mouseadapted Ebola virus while only  percent of unmodified mice survived this long In another study small molecules were shown to inhibit Ebola virus infection by preventing viral envelope glycoprotein GP from binding to NPC Hence NPC was shown to be critical to entry of this filovirus because it mediates infection by binding directly to viral GP
When cells from Niemann–Pick Type C individuals lacking this transporter were exposed to Ebola virus in the laboratory the cells survived and appeared impervious to the virus further indicating that Ebola relies on NPC to enter cells mutations in the NPC gene in humans were conjectured as a possible mode to make some individuals resistant to this deadly viral disease The same studies described similar results regarding NPCs role in virus entry for Marburg virus a related filovirus A further study has also presented evidence that NPC is the critical receptor mediating Ebola infection via its direct binding to the viral GP and that it is the second "lysosomal" domain of NPC that mediates this binding
The second candidate is TIM aka HAVCR TIM was shown to bind to the receptor binding domain of the EBOV glycoprotein to increase the receptivity of Vero cells Silencing its effect with siRNA prevented infection of Vero cells TIM is expressed in tissues known to be seriously impacted by EBOV lysis trachea cornea and conjunctiva A monoclonal antibody against the IgV domain of TIM ARD blocked EBOV binding and infection Together these studies suggest NPC and TIM may be potential therapeutic targets for an Ebola antiviral drug and as a basis for a rapid field diagnostic assaycitation needed
Being acellular viruses such as Ebola do not replicate through any type of cell division rather they use a combination of host and virally encoded enzymes alongside host cell structures to produce multiple copies of themselves These then selfassemble into viral macromolecular structures in the host cell The virus completes a set of steps when infecting each individual cell The virus begins its attack by attaching to host receptors through the glycoprotein GP surface peplomer and is endocytosed into macropinosomes in the host cell To penetrate the cell the viral membrane fuses with vesicle membrane and the nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm Encapsidated negativesense genomic ssRNA is used as a template for the synthesis  of polyadenylated monocistronic mRNAs and using the host cells ribosomes tRNA molecules etc the mRNA is translated into individual viral proteins
These viral proteins are processed a glycoprotein precursor GP is cleaved to GP and GP which are then heavily glycosylated using cellular enzymes and substrates These two molecules assemble first into heterodimers and then into trimers to give the surface peplomers Secreted glycoprotein sGP precursor is cleaved to sGP and delta peptide both of which are released from the cell As viral protein levels rise a switch occurs from translation to replication Using the negativesense genomic RNA as a template a complementary ssRNA is synthesized this is then used as a template for the synthesis of new genomic ssRNA which is rapidly encapsidated The newly formed nucleocapsids and envelope proteins associate at the host cells plasma membrane budding occurs destroying the cellcitation needed
Ebola virus is a zoonotic pathogen Intermediary hosts have been reported to be "various species of fruit bats  throughout central and subSaharan Africa" Evidence of infection in bats has been detected through molecular and serologic means However ebolaviruses have not been isolated in bats End hosts are humans and great apes infected through bat contact or through other end hosts Pigs in the Philippines have been reported to be infected with Reston virus so other interim or amplifying hosts may exist Ebola virus outbreaks tend to occur when temperatures are lower and humidity is higher than usual for Africa Even after a person recovers from the acute phase of the disease Ebola virus survives for months in certain organs such as the eyes and testes
Zaire ebolavirus is one of the four ebolaviruses known to cause disease in humans It has the highest casefatality rate of these ebolaviruses averaging  percent since the first outbreaks in  although a fatality rate of up to  percent was recorded in one outbreak in the Republic of the Congo between December  and April  There have also been more outbreaks of Zaire ebolavirus than of any other ebolavirus The first outbreak occurred on  August  in Yambuku The first recorded case was Mabalo Lokela a ‑yearold schoolteacher The symptoms resembled malaria and subsequent patients received quinine Transmission has been attributed to reuse of unsterilized needles and close personal contact body fluids and places where the person has touched During the  Ebola outbreak in Zaire Ngoy Mushola travelled from Bumba to Yambuku where he recorded the first clinical description of the disease in his daily log
The illness is characterized with a high temperature of about °C hematemesis diarrhea with blood retrosternal abdominal pain prostration with "heavy" articulations and rapid evolution death after a mean of three daysSince the first recorded clinical description of the disease during  in Zaire the recent Ebola outbreak that started in March  in addition reached epidemic proportions and has killed more than  people as of January  This outbreak was centered in West Africa an area that had not previously been affected by the disease The toll was particularly grave in three countries Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone A few cases were also reported in countries outside of West Africa all related to international travelers who were exposed in the most affected regions and later showed symptoms of Ebola fever after reaching their destinations
The severity of the disease in humans varies widely from rapid fatality to mild illness or even asymptomatic response Studies of outbreaks in the late twentieth century failed to find a correlation between the disease severity and the genetic nature of the virus Hence the variability in the severity of illness was suspected to correlate with genetic differences in the victims This has been difficult to study in animal models that respond to the virus with hemorrhagic fever in a similar manner as humans because typical mouse models do not so respond and the required large numbers of appropriate test subjects are not easily available In late October  a publication reported a study of the response to a mouseadapted strain of Zaire ebolavirus presented by a genetically diverse population of mice that was bred to have a range of responses to the virus that includes fatality from hemorrhagic fever
In December  a study found the VSVEBOV vaccine to be – effective against the Ebola virus making it the first vaccine against the disease  VSVEBOV was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in December 
Ebola virus was first identified as a possible new "strain" of Marburg virus in  The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ICTV identifies Ebola virus as species Zaire ebolavirus which is part of the genus Ebolavirus family Filoviridae order Mononegavirales The name "Ebola virus" is derived from the Ebola Rivera river that was at first thought to be in close proximity to the area in Democratic Republic of Congo previously called Zaire where the  Zaire Ebola virus outbreak occurredand the taxonomic suffix virus
In  the virus name was changed to "Zaire Ebola virus" and in  to species Zaire ebolavirus However most scientific articles continued to refer to "Ebola virus" or used the terms "Ebola virus" and "Zaire ebolavirus" in parallel Consequently in  a group of researchers recommended that the name "Ebola virus" be adopted for a subclassification within the species Zaire ebolavirus with the corresponding abbreviation EBOV Previous abbreviations for the virus were EBOVZ for "Ebola virus Zaire" and ZEBOV for "Zaire Ebola virus" or "Zaire ebolavirus" In  the ICTV explicitly rejected a proposal bV to recognize this name as ICTV does not designate names for subtypes variants strains or other subspecies level groupings At present ICTV does not officially recognize "Ebola virus" as a taxonomic rank but rather continues to use and recommend only the species designation Zaire ebolavirus The prototype Ebola virus variant Mayinga EBOVMay was named for Mayinga NSeka a nurse who died during the  Zaire outbreak
The name Zaire ebolavirus is derived from Zaire and the taxonomic suffix ebolavirus which denotes an ebolavirus species and refers to the Ebola River According to the rules for taxon naming established by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ICTV the name Zaire ebolavirus is always to be capitalized italicized and to be preceded by the word "species" The names of its members Zaire ebolaviruses are to be capitalized are not italicized and used without articles
A virus of the genus Ebolavirus is a member of the species Zaire ebolavirus if
Zaire ebolavirus diverged from its ancestors between  and  The genetic diversity of Ebolavirus remained constant before  Then around the s most likely due to climate change or human activities the genetic diversity of the virus dropped rapidly and most lineages became extinct As the number of susceptible hosts declines so does the effective population size and its genetic diversity This genetic bottleneck effect has implications for the species ability to cause Ebola virus disease in human hostscitation needed
A recombination event between Zaire ebolavirus lineages likely took place between  and  in wild apes giving rise to recombinant progeny viruses  These recombinant viruses appear to have been responsible for a series of outbreaks among humans in Central Africa in –
Zaire ebolavirus – Makona variant caused the  West Africa outbreak The outbreak was characterized by the longest instance of humantohuman transmission of the viral species Pressures to adapt to the human host were seen at this time however no phenotypic changes in the virus such as increased transmission increased immune evasion by the virus were seencitation needed
