Cowpox is an infectious disease caused by the cowpox virus CPXV It presents with large blisters in the skin a fever and swollen glands typically following contact with an infected cow The hands and face are most frequently affected and the spots are generally very painful
The virus part of the genus Orthopoxvirus is closely related to the vaccinia virus The virus is zoonotic meaning that it is transferable between species such as from cat to human The transferral of the disease was first observed in dairymaids who touched the udders of infected cows and consequently developed the signature pustules on their hands Cowpox is more commonly found in animals other than bovines such as rodents Cowpox is similar to but much milder than the highly contagious and often deadly smallpox disease Its close resemblance to the mild form of smallpox and the observation that dairy farmers were immune to smallpox inspired the modern smallpox vaccine created and administered by English physician Edward Jenner
The first description of cowpox was given by Jenner in  "Vaccination" is derived from the Latin adjective vaccinus meaning "of or from the cow"  Once vaccinated a patient develops antibodies that make them immune to cowpox but they also develop immunity to the smallpox virus or Variola virus The cowpox vaccinations and later incarnations proved so successful that in  the World Health Organization announced that smallpox was the first disease to be eradicated by vaccination efforts worldwide Other orthopox viruses remain prevalent in certain communities and continue to infect humans such as the cowpox virus in Europe vaccinia in Brazil and monkeypox virus in Central and West Africacitation needed
Naturally occurring cases of cowpox were not common but it was discovered that the vaccine could be carried in humans and reproduced and disseminated humantohuman Jenners original vaccination used lymph from the cowpox pustule on a milkmaid and subsequent armtoarm vaccinations applied the same principle As this transfer of human fluids came with its own set of complications a safer manner of producing the vaccine was first introduced in Italy The new method used cows to manufacture the vaccine using a process called retrovaccination" in which a heifer was inoculated with humanized cowpox virus and it was passed from calf to calf to produce massive quantities efficiently and safely This then led to the next incarnation true animal vaccine which used the same process but began with naturallyoccurring cowpox virus and not the humanized formcitation needed
This method of production proved to be lucrative and was taken advantage of by many entrepreneurs needing only calves and seed lymph from an infected cow to manufacture crude versions of the vaccine W F Elgin of the National Vaccine Establishment presented his slightly refined technique to the Conference of State and Provincial Boards of Health of North America A tuberculosisfree calf stomach shaved would be bound to an operating table where incisions would be made on its lower body Glycerinated lymph from a previously inoculated calf was spread along the cuts After a few days the cuts would have scabbed or crusted over The crust was softened with sterilized water and mixed with glycerin which disinfected it then stored hermeticallysealed in capillary tubes for later usecitation needed
At some point the virus in use was no longer cowpox but vaccinia Scientists have not determined exactly when the change or mutation occurred but the effects of vaccinia and cowpox virus as vaccine are nearly the same
The virus is found in Europe and mainly in the UK Human cases today are very rare and most often contracted from domestic cats The virus is not commonly found in cattle the reservoir hosts for the virus are woodland rodents particularly voles From these rodents domestic cats contract and transmit the virus to humans
Symptoms in cats include lesions on the face neck forelimbs and paws and less commonly upper respiratory tract infections  Symptoms of infection with cowpox virus in humans are localized pustular lesions generally found on the hands and limited to the site of introductioncitation needed  The incubation period is  to  dayscitation needed The virus is prevalent in late summer and autumncitation needed
In the years from  to  at least six people who had contact with a cow had independently tested the possibility of using the cowpox vaccine as an immunization for smallpox in humans Among them were the English farmer Benjamin Jesty in Dorset in  and the German teacher Peter Plett in  Jesty inoculated his wife and two young sons with cowpox in a successful effort to immunize them to smallpox an epidemic of which had arisen in their town His patients who had contracted and recovered from the similar but milder cowpox mainly milkmaids seemed to be immune not only to further cases of cowpox but also to smallpox By scratching the fluid from cowpox lesions into the skin of healthy individuals he was able to immunize those people against smallpox
Reportedly farmers and people working regularly with cattle and horses were often spared during smallpox outbreaks Investigations by the British Army in  showed that horsemounted troops were less infected by smallpox than infantry due to probable exposure to the similar horsepox virus Variola equina By the early th century more than  people in Great Britain had been vaccinated The armtoarm method of transfer of the cowpox vaccine was also used to distribute Jenners vaccine throughout the Spanish Empire Spanish king  Charles IVs daughter had been stricken with smallpox in  and after she recovered he arranged for the rest of his family to be vaccinated
In  the king convinced of the benefits of the vaccine ordered his personal physician Francis Xavier de Balmis to deliver it to the Spanish dominions in North and South America To maintain the vaccine in an available state during the voyage the physician recruited  young boys who had never had cowpox or smallpox before aged three to nine years from the orphanages of Spain During the trip across the Atlantic de Balmis vaccinated the orphans in a living chain Two children were vaccinated immediately before departure and when cowpox pustules had appeared on their arms material from these lesions was used to vaccinate two more children
In  English medical practitioner Edward Jenner tested the theory that cowpox could protect someone from being infected by smallpox There had long been speculation regarding the origins of Jenners variolae vaccinae until DNA sequencing data showed close similarities between horsepox and cowpox viruses Jenner noted that farriers sometimes milked cows and that material from the equine disease could produce a vesicular disease in cows from which variolae vaccinae was derived  Contemporary accounts provide support for Jenners speculation that the vaccine probably originated as an equine disease called "grease"
Although cowpox originates on the udder of cows Jenner took his sample from a milkmaid Sarah Nelmes
Jenner extracted the pus of one of the lesions formed by cowpox on Nelmes to James Phipps an eightyearold boy who had never had smallpox He eventually developed a scab and fever that was manageable Approximately six weeks later Jenner then introduced an active sample of the smallpox virus into Phipps to test the theory After being observed for an extended amount of time it was recorded that Phipps did not receive a reaction from it Although Jenner was not the first person to conceive the notion of cowpox protecting against the smallpox virus his experiment proved the theory It was later discovered that the cowpox vaccination only worked temporarily against the invasion of smallpox and the procedure would need to be repeated several times through ones lifetime to remain smallpox freecitation needed
In later years Jenner popularized the experiment calling it a vaccination from the Latin for cow vacca The amount of vaccinations among people of that era increased drastically It was widely considered to be a relatively safer procedure compared to the mainstream inoculation Although Jenner was propelled into the spotlight from the vaccination popularity he mainly focused on science behind why the cowpox allowed persons to not be infected by smallpox The honour of the discovery of the vaccination is often attributed to Benjamin Jesty but he was no scientist and did not repeat or publish his findings He is considered to be the first to use cowpox as a vaccination though the term vaccination was not invented yet
During the midst of the smallpox outbreak Jesty transferred pieces of cow udder which he knew had been infected with cowpox into the skin of his family members in the hopes of protecting them Jesty did not publicize his findings and Jenner who performed his first inoculation  years later and publicized his findings assumed credit It is said that Jenner made this discovery by himself possibly without knowing previous accounts  years earlier Although Jesty may have been the first to discover it Jenner made vaccination widely accessible and has therefore been credited for its invention
The majority of the population at the time accepted the upandcoming vaccination However there was still opposition from individuals who were reluctant to change from the inoculations In addition there became a growing concern from parties who were worried about the unknown repercussions of infecting a human with an animal disease One way individuals expressed their discontent was to draw comics that sometimes depicted small cows growing from the sites of vaccination Others publicly advocated for the continuance of the inoculations however this was not because of their discontent for the vaccinations Some of their reluctance had to do with an apprehensiveness for change They had become so familiar with the process outcome positives and negatives of inoculations that they did not want to be surprised by the outcome or effects of the vaccinations Jenner soon eased their minds after extensive trials However others advocated against vaccinations for different reason Because of the high price of inoculation Jenner experienced very few common folk who were not willing to accept the vaccination Due to this Jenner found many subjects for his tests He was able to publish his results in a pamphlet in  An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of Variolae Vaccinae a Disease Discovered in some of the Western Counties of England particularly Gloucestershire and known by the Name of Cow Pox

After inoculation vaccination using the cowpox virus became the primary defense against smallpox After infection by the cowpox virus the body usually gains the ability to recognize the similar smallpox virus from its antigens and is able to fight the smallpox disease much more efficientlycitation needed
The cowpox virus contains  thousand base pairs of DNA which contains the information for about  genes This makes cowpox one of the most complicated viruses known Some  of these genes give instructions for key parts of the human immune system giving a clue as to why the closely related smallpox is so lethal The vaccinia virus now used for smallpox vaccination is sufficiently different from the cowpox virus found in the wild as to be considered a separate virus
While the vaccinations popularity increased exponentially so did its monetary value This was realized by the British Parliament which compensated Jenner  pounds for the vaccination In addition they later compensated Jenner an additional  pounds In the coming years Jenner continued advocacy for his vaccination over the still popular inoculation Eventually in  the inoculation became banned in England and was replaced with the cowpox vaccination as the main medical solution to combat smallpox The cowpox vaccination saved the British Army thousands of soldiers by making them immune to the effects of smallpox in upcoming wars The cowpox also saved the United Kingdom thousands of pounds
Kinepox is an alternative term for the smallpox vaccine used in early thcentury America Popularized by Jenner in the late s kinepox was a far safer method for inoculating people against smallpox than the previous method variolation which had a  fatality ratecitation needed
In a famous letter to Meriwether Lewis in  Thomas Jefferson instructed the Lewis and Clark expedition to "carry with you some matter of the kinepox inform those of them with whom you may be of its efficacy as a preservative from the smallpox  encourage them in the use of it" Jefferson had developed an interest in protecting American Indians from smallpox having been aware of epidemics along the Missouri River during the previous century A year before his special instructions to Lewis Jefferson had persuaded a visiting delegation of North American Indian chieftains to be vaccinated with kinepox during the winter of – Unfortunately Lewis never got the opportunity to use kinepox during the pairs expedition as it had become inadvertently inactivea common occurrence in a time before vaccines were stabilized with preservatives such as glycerol or kept at refrigeration temperatures
Today the virus is found in Europe mainly in the UK Human cases are very rare though in  a laboratory worker contracted cowpox and most often contracted from domestic cats Human infections usually remain localized and selflimiting but can become fatal in immunosuppressed patients The virus is not commonly found in cattle the reservoir hosts for the virus are woodland rodents particularly voles Domestic cats contract the virus from these rodents Symptoms in cats include lesions on the face neck forelimbs and paws and less commonly upper respiratory tract infections Symptoms of infection with cowpox virus in humans are localized pustular lesions generally found on the hands and limited to the site of introduction The incubation period is nine to ten days The virus is most prevalent in late summer and autumn
Immunity to cowpox is gained when the smallpox vaccine is administered Although the vaccine now uses vaccinia virus the poxviruses are similar enough that the body becomes immune to both cow and smallpox
