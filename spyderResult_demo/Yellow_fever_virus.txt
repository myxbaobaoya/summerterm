Yellow fever is a viral disease of typically short duration In most cases symptoms include fever chills loss of appetite nausea muscle pains – particularly in the back – and headaches Symptoms typically improve within five days In about  of people within a day of improving the fever comes back abdominal pain occurs and liver damage begins causing yellow skin If this occurs the risk of bleeding and kidney problems is increased
The disease is caused by the yellow fever virus and is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito It infects only humans other primates and several types of mosquitoes In cities it is spread primarily by Aedes aegypti a type of mosquito found throughout the tropics and subtropics The virus is an RNA virus of the genus Flavivirus The disease may be difficult to tell apart from other illnesses especially in the early stages To confirm a suspected case bloodsample testing with polymerase chain reaction is required
A safe and effective vaccine against yellow fever exists and some countries require vaccinations for travelers Other efforts to prevent infection include reducing the population of the transmitting mosquitoes In areas where yellow fever is common early diagnosis of cases and immunization of large parts of the population are important to prevent outbreaks Once a person is infected management is symptomatic no specific measures are effective against the virus Death occurs in up to half of those who get severe disease
In  yellow fever resulted in about  severe infections and  deaths worldwide with nearly  percent of these occurring in Africa Nearly a billion people live in an area of the world where the disease is common It is common in tropical areas of the continents of South America and Africa but not in Asia Since the s the number of cases of yellow fever has been increasing This is believed to be due to fewer people being immune more people living in cities people moving frequently and changing climate increasing the habitat for mosquitoes
The disease originated in Africa and spread to the Americas starting in the th century with the European trafficking of enslaved Africans from subSaharan Africa  Since the th century several major outbreaks of the disease have occurred in the Americas Africa and Europe In the th and th centuries yellow fever was considered one of the most dangerous infectious diseases numerous epidemics swept through major cities of the US and in other parts of the world
In  yellow fever virus was the first human virus to be isolated
Yellow fever begins after an incubation period of three to six days Most cases cause only a mild infection with fever headache chills back pain fatigue loss of appetite muscle pain nausea and vomiting In these cases the infection lasts only three to six days
But in  of cases people enter a second toxic phase of the disease characterized by recurring fever this time accompanied by jaundice due to liver damage as well as abdominal pain Bleeding in the mouth nose the eyes and the gastrointestinal tract cause vomit containing blood hence the Spanish name for yellow fever vómito negro "black vomit" There may also be kidney failure hiccups and delirium
Among those who develop jaundice the fatality rate is  to  while the overall fatality rate is about  to  Severe cases may have a mortality greater than 
Surviving the infection provides lifelong immunity and normally results in no permanent organ damage
Yellow fever is caused by yellow fever virus an enveloped RNA virus – nm in width the type species and namesake of the family Flaviviridae It was the first illness shown to be transmissible by filtered human serum and transmitted by mosquitoes by American doctor Walter Reed around  The positivesense singlestranded RNA is around  nucleotides long and has a single open reading frame encoding a polyproteinHost proteases cut this polyprotein into three structural C prM E and seven nonstructural proteins NS NSA NSB NS NSA NSB NS the enumeration corresponds to the arrangement of the protein coding genes in the genome Minimal yellow fever virus YFV UTR region is required for stalling of the host  exonuclease XRN The UTR contains PKS pseudoknot structure which serves as a molecular signal to stall the exonuclease and is the only viral requirement for subgenomic flavivirus RNA sfRNA production The sfRNAs are a result of incomplete degradation of the viral genome by the exonuclease and are important for viral pathogenicity Yellow fever belongs to the group of hemorrhagic fevers
The viruses infect amongst others monocytes macrophages Schwann cells and dendritic cells They attach to the cell surfaces via specific receptors and are taken up by an endosomal vesicle Inside the endosome the decreased pH induces the fusion of the endosomal membrane with the virus envelope The capsid enters the cytosol decays and releases the genome Receptor binding as well as membrane fusion are catalyzed by the protein E which changes its conformation at low pH causing a rearrangement of the  homodimers to  homotrimers
After entering the host cell the viral genome is replicated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum ER and in the socalled vesicle packets At first an immature form of the virus particle is produced inside the ER whose Mprotein is not yet cleaved to its mature form so is denoted as precursor M prM and forms a complex with protein E The immature particles are processed in the Golgi apparatus by the host protein furin which cleaves prM to M This releases E from the complex which can now take its place in the mature infectious virionu
Yellow fever virus is mainly transmitted through the bite of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti but other mostly Aedes mosquitoes such as the tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus can also serve as a vector for this virus Like other arboviruses which are transmitted by mosquitoes yellow fever virus is taken up by a female mosquito when it ingests the blood of an infected human or another primate Viruses reach the stomach of the mosquito and if the virus concentration is high enough the virions can infect epithelial cells and replicate there From there they reach the haemocoel the blood system of mosquitoes and from there the salivary glands When the mosquito next sucks blood it injects its saliva into the wound and the virus reaches the bloodstream of the bitten personTransovarial transmissionial and transstadial transmission of yellow ever virus within A aegypti that is the transmission from a female mosquito to its eggs and then larvae are indicated This infection of vectors without a previous blood meal seems to play a role in single sudden breakouts of the disease
Three epidemiologically different infectious cycles occur in which the virus is transmitted from mosquitoes to humans or other primates In the "urban cycle" only the yellow fever mosquito A aegypti is involved It is well adapted to urban areas and can also transmit other diseases including Zika fever dengue fever and chikungunya The urban cycle is responsible for the major outbreaks of yellow fever that occur in Africa Except for an outbreak in Bolivia in  this urban cycle no longer exists in South America
Besides the urban cycle both in Africa and South America a sylvatic cycle forest or jungle cycle is present where Aedes africanus in Africa or mosquitoes of the genus Haemagogus and Sabethes in South America serve as vectors In the jungle the mosquitoes infect mainly nonhuman primates the disease is mostly asymptomatic in African primates In South America the sylvatic cycle is currently the only way humans can become infected which explains the low incidence of yellow fever cases on the continent People who become infected in the jungle can carry the virus to urban areas where A aegypti acts as a vector Because of this sylvatic cycle yellow fever cannot be eradicated except by eradicating the mosquitoes that serve as vectors
In Africa a third infectious cycle known as "savannah cycle" or intermediate cycle occurs between the jungle and urban cycles Different mosquitoes of the genus Aedes are involved In recent years this has been the most common form of transmission of yellow fever in Africa
Concern exists about yellow fever spreading to southeast Asia where its vector A aegypti already occurs
After transmission from a mosquito the viruses replicate in the lymph nodes and infect dendritic cells in particular From there they reach the liver and infect hepatocytes probably indirectly via Kupffer cells which leads to eosinophilic degradation of these cells and to the release of cytokines Apoptotic masses known as Councilman bodies appear in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes
Fatality may occur when cytokine storm shock and multiple organ failure follow
Yellow fever is most frequently a clinical diagnosis based on symptomatology and travel history Mild cases of the disease can only be confirmed virologically Since mild cases of yellow fever can also contribute significantly to regional outbreaks every suspected case of yellow fever involving symptoms of fever pain nausea and vomiting – days after leaving the affected area is treated seriously
If yellow fever is suspected the virus cannot be confirmed until – days following the illness A direct confirmation can be obtained by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction where the genome of the virus is amplified Another direct approach is the isolation of the virus and its growth in cell culture using blood plasma this can take – weeks
Serologically an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay during the acute phase of the disease using specific IgM against yellow fever or an increase in specific IgG titer compared to an earlier sample can confirm yellow fever Together with clinical symptoms the detection of IgM or a fourfold increase in IgG titer is considered sufficient indication for yellow fever As these tests can crossreact with other flaviviruses such as dengue virus these indirect methods cannot conclusively prove yellow fever infection
Liver biopsy can verify inflammation and necrosis of hepatocytes and detect viral antigens Because of the bleeding tendency of yellow fever patients a biopsy is only advisable post mortem to confirm the cause of death
In a differential diagnosis infections with yellow fever must be distinguished from other feverish illnesses such as malaria Other viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola virus Lassa virus Marburg virus and Junin virus must be excluded as the cause
Personal prevention of yellow fever includes vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites in areas where yellow fever is endemic Institutional measures for prevention of yellow fever include vaccination programmes and measures to control mosquitoes Programmes for distribution of mosquito nets for use in homes produce reductions in cases of both malaria and yellow fever Use of EPAregistered insect repellent is recommended when outdoors Exposure for even a short time is enough for a potential mosquito bite Longsleeved clothing long pants and socks are useful for prevention The application of larvicides to waterstorage containers can help eliminate potential mosquito breeding sites EPAregistered insecticide spray decreases the transmission of yellow fever
Vaccination is recommended for those traveling to affected areas because nonnative people tend to develop more severe illness when infected Protection begins by the th day after vaccine administration in  of people and had been reported to last for at least  years The World Health Organization WHO now states that a single dose of vaccine is sufficient to confer lifelong immunity against yellow fever disease The attenuated live vaccine stem D was developed in  by Max Theiler The WHO recommends routine vaccination for people living in affected areas between the th and th month after birth
Up to one in four people experience fever aches and local soreness and redness at the site of injection In rare cases less than one in  to  the vaccination can cause yellow fever vaccineassociated viscerotropic disease which is fatal in  of cases It is probably due to the genetic morphology of the immune system Another possible side effect is an infection of the nervous system which occurs in one in  to  cases causing yellow fever vaccineassociated neurotropic disease which can lead to meningoencephalitis and is fatal in less than  of cases
The Yellow Fever Initiative launched by the WHO in  vaccinated more than  million people in  countries in West Africa No outbreaks were reported during  The campaign was supported by the GAVI alliance and governmental organizations in Europe and Africa According to the WHO mass vaccination cannot eliminate yellow fever because of the vast number of infected mosquitoes in urban areas of the target countries but it will significantly reduce the number of people infected
Demand for yellow fever vaccine has continued to increase due to the growing number of countries implementing yellow fever vaccination as part of their routine immunization programmes Recent upsurges in yellow fever outbreaks in Angola  the Democratic Republic of Congo  Uganda  and more recently in Nigeria and Brazil in  have further increased demand while straining global vaccine supply Therefore to vaccinate susceptible populations in preventive mass immunization campaigns during outbreaks fractional dosing of the vaccine is being considered as a dosesparing strategy to maximize limited vaccine supplies Fractional dose yellow fever vaccination refers to administration of a reduced volume of vaccine dose which has been reconstituted as per manufacturer recommendations The first practical use of fractional dose yellow fever vaccination was in response to a large yellow fever outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in mid
In March  the WHO launched a vaccination campaign in Brazil with  million doses from an emergency stockpile In March  the WHO recommended vaccination for travellers to certain parts of Brazil In March  Brazil shifted its policy and announced it planned to vaccinate all  million currently unvaccinated citizens by April 
Some countries in Asia are considered to be potentially in danger of yellow fever epidemics as both mosquitoes with the capability to transmit yellow fever as well as susceptible monkeys are present The disease does not yet occur in Asia To prevent introduction of the virus some countries demand previous vaccination of foreign visitors who have passed through yellow fever areas Vaccination has to be proved by a vaccination certificate which is valid  days after the vaccination and lasts for  years Although the WHO on  May  advised that subsequent booster vaccinations are unnecessary an older than  years certificate may not be acceptable at all border posts in all affected countries A list of the countries that require yellow fever vaccination is published by the WHO If the vaccination cannot be given for some reason dispensation may be possible In this case an exemption certificate issued by a WHOapproved vaccination center is required Although  of  countries where yellow fever occurs endemically do have vaccination programmes in many of these countries less than  of their population is vaccinated
Control of the yellow fever mosquito A aegypti is of major importance especially because the same mosquito can also transmit dengue fever and chikungunya disease A aegypti breeds preferentially in water for example in installations by inhabitants of areas with precarious drinking water supplies or in domestic refuse especially tires cans and plastic bottles These conditions are common in urban areas in developing countries
Two main strategies are employed to reduce A aegypti populations One approach is to kill the developing larvae Measures are taken to reduce the water accumulations in which the larvae develop Larvicides are used along with larvaeeating fish and copepods which reduce the number of larvae For many years copepods of the genus Mesocyclops have been used in Vietnam for preventing dengue fever This eradicated the mosquito vector in several areas Similar efforts may prove effective against yellow fever Pyriproxyfen is recommended as a chemical larvicide mainly because it is safe for humans and effective in small doses
The second strategy is to reduce populations of the adult yellow fever mosquito Lethal ovitraps can reduce Aedes populations using lesser amounts of pesticide because it targets the pest directly Curtains and lids of water tanks can be sprayed with insecticides but application inside houses is not recommended by the WHO Insecticidetreated mosquito nets are effective just as they are against the Anopheles mosquito that carries malaria
Yellow fever can lead to death for  to  of those who develop severe disease Jaundice fatigue heart rhythm problems seizures and internal bleeding may also appear as complications of yellow fever during recovery time
As with other Flavivirus infections no cure is known for yellow fever Hospitalization is advisable and intensive care may be necessary because of rapid deterioration in some cases Certain acute treatment methods lack efficacy passive immunization after the emergence of symptoms is probably without effect ribavirin and other antiviral drugs as well as treatment with interferons are ineffective in yellow fever patients Symptomatic treatment includes rehydration and pain relief with drugs such as paracetamol acetaminophen Acetylsalicylic acid aspirin However aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs are often avoided because of an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to their anticoagulant effects
Yellow fever is common in tropical and subtropical areas of South America and Africa Worldwide about  million people live in endemic areas The WHO estimates  cases of yellow fever worldwide each year About  of people infected with yellow fever progress to a severe form of the illness and up to half of those will die as there is no cure for yellow fever
An estimated  of yellow fever infections occur on the African continent In  a large outbreak originated in Angola and spread to neighboring countries before being contained by a massive vaccination campaign In March and April   imported cases of the Angola genotype in unvaccinated Chinese nationals were reported in China the first appearance of the disease in Asia in recorded history
Phylogenetic analysis has identified seven genotypes of yellow fever viruses and they are assumed to be differently adapted to humans and to the vector A aegypti Five genotypes Angola CentralEast Africa East Africa West Africa I and West Africa II occur only in Africa West Africa genotype I is found in Nigeria and the surrounding region West Africa genotype I appears to be especially infectious as it is often associated with major outbreaks The three genotypes found outside of Nigeria and Angola occur in areas where outbreaks are rare Two outbreaks in Kenya – and Sudan  and  involved the East African genotype which had remained undetected in the previous  years
In South America two genotypes have been identified South American genotypes I and II Based on phylogenetic analysis these two genotypes appear to have originated in West Africa and were first introduced into Brazil The date of introduction of the predecessor African genotype which gave rise to the South American genotypes appears to be   confidence interval  to  The historical record shows an outbreak of yellow fever occurred in Recife Brazil between  and  The disease seems to have disappeared with the next outbreak occurring in  It was likely introduced with the trafficking of slaves through the slave trade from Africa Genotype I has been divided into five subclades A through E
In late  a large outbreak began in Minas Gerais state of Brazil that was characterized as a sylvan or jungle epizootic It began as an outbreak in brown howler monkeys which serve as a sentinel species for yellow fever that then spread to men working in the jungle No cases had been transmitted between humans by the A aegypti mosquito which can sustain urban outbreaks that can spread rapidly In April  the sylvan outbreak continued moving toward the Brazilian coast where most people were unvaccinated By the end of May the outbreak appeared to be declining after more than  suspected cases  confirmed and  deaths confirmed to be yellow fever The Health Ministry launched a vaccination campaign and was concerned about spread during the Carnival season in February and March The CDC issued a Level  alert practice enhanced precautions
A Bayesian analysis of genotypes I and II has shown that genotype I accounts for virtually all the current infections in Brazil Colombia Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago while genotype II accounted for all cases in Peru Genotype I originated in the northern Brazilian region around   highest posterior density interval HPD – Genotype II originated in Peru in   HPD – The estimated rate of mutation for both genotypes was about  × − substitutionssiteyear similar to that of other RNA viruses
The main vector A aegypti also occurs in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia the Pacific and Australia but yellow fever has never occurred there until jet travel introduced  cases from the  Angola and DR Congo yellow fever outbreak in Africa Proposed explanations include
But none is considered satisfactory Another proposal is the absence of a slave trade to Asia on the scale of that to the Americas The transAtlantic slave trade probably introduced yellow fever into the Western Hemisphere from Africa
The evolutionary origins of yellow fever most likely lie in Africa with transmission of the disease from nonhuman primates to humans The virus is thought to have originated in East or Central Africa and spread from there to West Africa As it was endemic in Africa local populations had developed some immunity to it When an outbreak of yellow fever would occur in an African community where colonists resided most Europeans died while the indigenous Africans usually developed nonlethal symptoms resembling influenza This phenomenon in which certain populations develop immunity to yellow fever due to prolonged exposure in their childhood is known as acquired immunity The virus as well as the vector A aegypti were probably transferred to North and South America with the trafficking of slaves from Africa part of the Columbian exchange following European exploration and colonization
The first definitive outbreak of yellow fever in the New World was in  on the island of Barbados An outbreak was recorded by Spanish colonists in  in the Yucatán Peninsula where the indigenous Mayan people called the illness xekik "blood vomit" In  Brazil suffered its first epidemic in Recife The first mention of the disease by the name "yellow fever" occurred in

In Colonial times and during the Napoleonic Wars the West Indies were known as a particularly dangerous posting for soldiers due to yellow fever being endemic in the area The mortality rate in British garrisons in Jamaica was seven times that of garrisons in Canada mostly because of yellow fever and other tropical diseases Both English and French forces posted there were seriously affected by the "yellow jack" Wanting to regain control of the lucrative sugar trade in SaintDomingue Hispaniola and with an eye on regaining Frances New World empire Napoleon sent an army under the command of his brotherinlaw General Charles Leclerc to SaintDomingue to seize control after a slave revolt The historian J R McNeill asserts that yellow fever accounted for about  to  casualties of these forces during the fighting Only one third of the French troops survived for withdrawal and return to France Napoleon gave up on the island and his plans for North America selling the Louisiana Purchase to the US in  In  Haiti proclaimed its independence as the second republic in the Western Hemisphere Considerable debate exists over whether the number of deaths caused by disease in the Haitian Revolution was exaggerated
Although yellow fever is most prevalent in tropicallike climates the northern United States were not exempted from the fever The first outbreak in Englishspeaking North America occurred in New York City in  English colonists in Philadelphia and the French in the Mississippi River Valley recorded major outbreaks in  as well as additional yellow fever epidemics in Philadelphia Baltimore and New York City in the th and th centuries The disease traveled along steamboat routes from New Orleans causing some – deaths in total The yellow fever epidemic of  in Philadelphia which was then the capital of the United States resulted in the deaths of several thousand people more than  of the population One of these deaths was James Hutchinson a physician helping to treat the population of the city The national government fled the city to Trenton New Jersey including President George Washington
The southern city of New Orleans was plagued with major epidemics during the th century most notably in  and  A major epidemic occurred in both New Orleans and Shreveport Louisiana in  Its residents called the disease "yellow jack" Urban epidemics continued in the United States until  with the last outbreak affecting New Orleans
At least  major outbreaks took place in the Americas during the th and th centuries including particularly serious ones in Cartagena Chile in  Cuba in  and  Santo Domingo in  and Memphis Tennessee in 
In the early nineteenth century the prevalence of yellow fever in the Caribbean "led to serious health problems" and alarmed the United States Navy as numerous deaths and sickness curtailed naval operations and destroyed morale One episode began in April  when the frigate USS Macedonian left Boston and became part of Commodore James Biddles West India Squadron Unbeknownst to all they were about to embark on a cruise to disaster and their assignment "would prove a cruise through hell" Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson had assigned the squadron to guard United States merchant shipping and suppress piracyDuring their time on deployment from  May to  August   of the Macedonians officers and men died including John Cadle surgeon USN Seventyfour of these deaths were attributed to yellow fever Biddle reported that another  of his crew were on sicklist In their report to the secretary of the Navy Biddle and Surgeons Mate Charles Chase stated the cause as "fever" As a consequence of this loss Biddle noted that his squadron was forced to return to Norfolk Navy Yard early Upon arrival the Macedonians crew were provided medical care and quarantined at Craney Island Virginia
In  Cloutierville Louisiana had a latesummer outbreak of yellow fever that quickly killed  of the  inhabitants A local doctor concluded that some unspecified infectious agent had arrived in a package from New Orleans In   residents of Savannah Georgia died from yellow fever In  St Matthews German Evangelical Lutheran Church in Charleston South Carolina suffered  yellow fever deaths reducing the congregation by half A ship carrying persons infected with the virus arrived in Hampton Roads in southeastern Virginia in June  The disease spread quickly through the community eventually killing over  people mostly residents of Norfolk and Portsmouth In  Shreveport Louisiana lost  citizens in an day period to a yellow fever epidemic with over  additional victims eventually succumbing The total death toll from August through November was approximately 
In  about  people died in a widespread epidemic in the Mississippi River Valley That year Memphis had an unusually large amount of rain which led to an increase in the mosquito population The result was a huge epidemic of yellow fever The steamship John D Porter took people fleeing Memphis northward in hopes of escaping the disease but passengers were not allowed to disembark due to concerns of spreading yellow fever The ship roamed the Mississippi River for the next two months before unloading her passengers
Major outbreaks have also occurred in southern Europe Gibraltar lost many lives to outbreaks in   and  Barcelona suffered the loss of several thousand citizens during an outbreak in  The Duke de Richelieu deployed  French troops to the border between France and Spain in the Pyrenees Mountains to establish a cordon sanitaire in order to prevent the epidemic from spreading from Spain into France
Ezekiel Stone Wiggins known as the Ottawa Prophet proposed that the cause of a yellow fever epidemic in Jacksonville Florida in  was astrological
The planets were in the same line as the sun and earth and this produced besides Cyclones Earthquakes etc a denser atmosphere holding more carbon and creating microbes Mars had an uncommonly dense atmosphere but its inhabitants were probably protected from the fever by their newly discovered canals which were perhaps made to absorb carbon and prevent the diseaseIn  Josiah C Nott suggested that yellow fever was spread by insects such as moths or mosquitoes basing his ideas on the pattern of transmission of the disease Carlos Finlay a Cuban doctor and scientist proposed in  that yellow fever might be transmitted by previously infected mosquitoes rather than by direct contact from person to person as had long been believed Since the losses from yellow fever in the Spanish–American War in the s were extremely high Army doctors began research experiments with a team led by Walter Reed and composed of doctors James Carroll Aristides Agramonte and Jesse William Lazear They successfully proved Finlays "mosquito hypothesis" Yellow fever was the first virus shown to be transmitted by mosquitoes The physician William Gorgas applied these insights and eradicated yellow fever from Havana He also campaigned against yellow fever during the construction of the Panama Canal A previous effort of canal building by the French had failed in part due to mortality from the high incidence of yellow fever and malaria which killed many workers
Although Reed has received much of the credit in United States history books for "beating" yellow fever he had fully credited Finlay with the discovery of the yellow fever vector and how it might be controlled Reed often cited Finlays papers in his own articles and also credited him for the discovery in his personal correspondence The acceptance of Finlays work was one of the most important and farreaching effects of the US Army Yellow Fever Commission of  Applying methods first suggested by Finlay the United States government and Army eradicated yellow fever in Cuba and later in Panama allowing completion of the Panama Canal While Reed built on the research of Finlay historian François Delaporte notes that yellow fever research was a contentious issue Scientists including Finlay and Reed became successful by building on the work of less prominent scientists without always giving them the credit they were due Reeds research was essential in the fight against yellow fever He is also credited for using the first type of medical consent form during his experiments in Cuba an attempt to ensure that participants knew they were taking a risk by being part of testing
Like Cuba and Panama Brazil also led a highly successful sanitation campaign against mosquitoes and yellow fever Beginning in  the campaign led by Oswaldo Cruz then director general of public health resulted not only in eradicating the disease but also in reshaping the physical landscape of Brazilian cities such as Rio de Janeiro During rainy seasons Rio de Janeiro had regularly suffered floods as water from the bay surrounding the city overflowed into Rios narrow streets Coupled with the poor drainage systems found throughout Rio this created swampy conditions in the citys neighborhoods Pools of stagnant water stood yearlong in city streets and proved to be a fertile ground for diseasecarrying mosquitoes Thus under Cruzs direction public health units known as "mosquito inspectors" fiercely worked to combat yellow fever throughout Rio by spraying exterminating rats improving drainage and destroying unsanitary housing Ultimately the citys sanitation and renovation campaigns reshaped Rio de Janeiros neighborhoods Its poor residents were pushed from city centers to Rios suburbs or to towns found in the outskirts of the city In later years Rios most impoverished inhabitants would come to reside in favelas
During – the Rockefeller Foundations International Health Board  undertook an expensive and successful yellow fever eradication campaign in Mexico The IHB gained the respect of Mexicos federal government because of the success The eradication of yellow fever strengthened the relationship between the US and Mexico which had not been very good in the years prior The eradication of yellow fever was also a major step toward better global health
In  scientists isolated the yellow fever virus in West Africa Following this two vaccines were developed in the s Max Theiler led the completion of the D yellow fever vaccine in  for which he was subsequently awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine That vaccine D is still in use although newer vaccines based on vero cells are in development as of 
Using vector control and strict vaccination programs the urban cycle of yellow fever was nearly eradicated from South America Since  only a single urban outbreak in Santa Cruz de la Sierra Bolivia has occurred Since the s however the number of yellow fever cases has been increasing again and A aegypti has returned to the urban centers of South America This is partly due to limitations on available insecticides as well as habitat dislocations caused by climate change It is also because the vector control program was abandoned Although no new urban cycle has yet been established scientists believe this could happen again at any point An outbreak in Paraguay in  was thought to be urban in nature but this ultimately proved not to be the case
In Africa virus eradication programs have mostly relied upon vaccination These programs have largely been unsuccessful because they were unable to break the sylvatic cycle involving wild primates With few countries establishing regular vaccination programs measures to fight yellow fever have been neglected making the future spread of the virus more likely
In the hamster model of yellow fever early administration of the antiviral ribavirin is an effective treatment of many pathological features of the disease Ribavirin treatment during the first five days after virus infection improved survival rates reduced tissue damage in the liver and spleen prevented hepatocellular steatosis and normalised levels of alanine aminotransferase a liver damage marker The mechanism of action of ribavirin in reducing liver pathology in yellow fever virus infection may be similar to its activity in treatment of hepatitis C a related virus Because ribavirin had failed to improve survival in a virulent rhesus model of yellow fever infection it had been previously discounted as a possible therapy Infection was reduced in mosquitoes with the wMel strain of Wolbachia
Yellow fever has been researched by several countries as a potential biological weapon
