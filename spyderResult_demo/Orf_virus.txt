Orf is a farmyard pox a type of zoonosis It causes small pustules in the skin of primarily sheep and goats but can also occur on the hands of humans A pale halo forms around a red centre It may persist for several weeks before crusting and then either resolves or leaves a hard lump There is usually only one lesion but there may be many and they are not painful Sometimes there are swollen lymph glands
It is caused by a Parapoxvirus It can occur in humans who handle infected animals or contaminated objects One third of cases may develop erythema multiforme Once resolved a person can still be infected again
Generally treatment options are limited Injecting the lesion with cidofovir or applying imiquimod has been tried It is sometimes necessary to cut them out The vaccine used in sheep to prevent orf in sheep is live and has been known to cause disease in humans
The disease is endemic in livestock herds It emerged in southwest Ethiopia between October  and May 
Orf is a zoonotic disease meaning humans can contract this disorder through direct contact with infected sheep and goats or with fomites carrying the orf virus It causes a purulentappearing papule locally and generally no systemic symptoms Infected locations can include the finger hand arm face and even the penis caused by infection either from contact with the hand during urination or from bestiality Consequently it is important to observe good personal hygiene and to wear gloves when treating infected animals It may appear similar to cowpox and pseudocowpox
While orf is usually a benign selflimiting illness which resolves in  weeks in the immunocompromised it can be very progressive and even lifethreatening One percent topical cidofovir has been successfully used in a few patients with progressive disease Serious damage may be inflicted on the eye if it is infected by orf even among healthy individuals The virus can survive in the soil for at least six months
Orf is primarily a disease of sheep and goats although it has been reported as a natural disease in humans steenbok and alpacas chamois and tahrs reindeer musk oxen dogs cats mountain goats bighorn sheep dall sheep and red squirrels
It has been recorded since the late th century and has been reported from most sheepor goatraising areas including those in Europe the Middle East the United States Africa Asia South America Canada New Zealand and Australia Orf is spread by fomites and direct contact In some environments infection is injected by scratches from thistles of both growing and felled plants Symptoms include papules and pustules on the lips and muzzle and less commonly in the mouth of young lambs and on the eyelids feet and teats of ewes The lesions progress to thick crusts which may bleed Orf in the mouths of lambs may prevent suckling and cause weight loss and can infect the udder of the mother ewe thus potentially leading to mastitis Sheep are prone to reinfection Occasionally the infection can be extensive and persistent if the animal does not produce an immune response
A live virus vaccine ATCvet code QIAD WHO is made from scab material and usually given to ewes at the age of two months but only to lambs when there is an outbreak The vaccine can cause disease in humanscitation needed
In sheep and goats the lesions mostly appear on or near the hairline and elsewhere on the lips and muzzle In some cases the lesions appear on and in the nostrils around the eyes on the thigh coronet vulva udder and axilla In rare cases mostly involving young lambs lesions are found on the tongue gums roof of the mouth and the oesophagus It has also been reported a number of times to cause lesions in the rumen In one case it was shown that a severe form of orf virus caused an outbreak involving the gastrointestinal tract lungs heart as well as the buccal cavity cheeks tongue and lips Another severe case was reported pharyngitis genital lesions and infection of the hooves which led to lameness and in some cases sloughing of the hoof
More typically sheep will become free of orf within a week or so as the disease runs its course Sheep custodians can assist by ensuring infected lambs receive sufficient milk and separating out the infected stock to slow down crosstransmission to healthy animals It is advisable for those handling infected animals to wear disposable gloves to prevent cross infection and selfinfection A veterinarian must be contacted if there is a risk of misdiagnosis with other more serious conditions
