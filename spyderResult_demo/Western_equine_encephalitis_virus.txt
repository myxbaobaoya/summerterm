The Western equine encephalomyelitis virus is the causative agent of relatively uncommon viral disease Western equine encephalomyelitis WEE An alphavirus of the family Togaviridae the WEE virus is an arbovirus arthropodborne virus transmitted by mosquitoes of the genera Culex and Culiseta WEE is a recombinant virus between two other alphaviruses an ancestral Sindbis viruslike virus and an ancestral Eastern equine encephalitis viruslike virus There have been under  confirmed cases in the US since  This virus contains an envelope that is made up of glycoproteins and nucleic acids The virus is transmitted to people and horses by bites from infected mosquitoes Culex tarsalis and Aedes taeniorhynchus and birds during wet summer months  
According to the CDC geographic occurrence for this virus is worldwide and tends to be more prevalent in places in and around swampy areas where human populations tend to be limited  In the US WEE is seen primarily in states and Canadian provinces west of the Mississippi River  The disease is also seen in countries of South America WEE is commonly a subclinical infection symptomatic infections are uncommon  However the disease can cause serious sequelae in infants and children  Unlike Eastern equine encephalitis the overall mortality of WEE is low approximately  and is associated mostly with infection in the elderly Approximately â€“ of horses that acquire the virus will die or be put down There is no human vaccine for WEE and there are no licensed therapeutic drugs in the US for this infection The virus affects the brain and spinal cord of the infected host
WEE was discovered in  when a number of horses in the San Joaquin Valley of California USA died of a mysterious encephalitis Karl Friedrich Meyer investigated but was not able to isolate the pathogen from necropsies of horses that had been dead for some time and needed samples from an animal in the earlier stages of disease When the team heard of a horse that appeared to have encephalitis its owner threatened to shoot the scientists However Meyer was able to convince the farmers wife that the horse was dying anyway and to secretly signal him when the farmer was asleep in exchange for  as this was during the Great Depression this was a substantial amount of money Meyer and his colleagues hid in the bushes until the signal euthanized the horse and stole its head They successfully isolated WEEV from the brain tissue
Western equine encephalitis virus was one of more than a dozen agents that the United States researched as potential biological weapons before the nation suspended its biological weapons program
