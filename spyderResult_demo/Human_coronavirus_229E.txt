Human coronavirus E HCoVE is a species of coronavirus which infects humans and bats It is an enveloped positivesense singlestranded RNA virus which enters its host cell by binding to the APN receptor Along with Human coronavirus OC a member of the Betacoronavirus genus it is one of the viruses responsible for the common cold HCoVE is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus and subgenus Duvinacovirus
HCoVE transmits via dropletrespiration and fomites
HCoVE is associated with a range of respiratory symptoms ranging from the common cold to  highmorbidity outcomes such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis However such high morbidity outcomes are almost always seen in cases with coinfection with other respiratory pathogens there is a single published case report to date of a E infection that caused acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS in an otherwise healthy patient having no detectable coinfection with another pathogen HCoVE is also among the coronaviruses most frequently codetected with other respiratory viruses particularly with human respiratory syncytial virus HRSV
HCoVE is one of the seven human coronaviruses which include HCoVNL HCoVOC HCoVHKU 
MERSCoV SARSCoV and SARSCoV and are globally distributed However the viruses were detected in different parts of the world at different times of the year A NCBIstudy found a previous HCoVE infection in  –  of children of – months of age and in  of those – years of age
HCoVE is one of seven known coronaviruses to infect humans The other six are
Chloroquine a zinc ionophore inhibits the replication of Human coronavirus E in cell culture
Human HCoVE and human HCoVNL likely originated from bats
A researcher at the University of Chicago Dorothy Hamre first identified E in
