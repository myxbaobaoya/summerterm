Chikungunya is an infection caused by the Chikungunya virus CHIKV Symptoms include fever and joint pains These typically occur two to twelve days after exposure Other symptoms may include headache muscle pain joint swelling and a rash Symptoms usually improve within a week however occasionally the joint pain may last for months or years The risk of death is around  in  The very young old and those with other health problems are at risk of more severe disease
The virus is spread between people by two types of mosquitos Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti They mainly bite during the day The virus may circulate within a number of animals including birds and rodents Diagnosis is by either testing the blood for the viruss RNA or antibodies to the virus The symptoms can be mistaken for those of dengue fever and Zika fever It is believed most people become immune after a single infection
The best means of prevention is overall mosquito control and the avoidance of bites in areas where the disease is common This may be partly achieved by decreasing mosquito access to water and with the use of insect repellent and mosquito nets There is no vaccine and no specific treatment as of  Recommendations include rest fluids and medications to help with fever and joint pain
While the disease typically occurs in Africa and Asia outbreaks have been reported in Europe and the Americas since the s In  more than a million suspected cases occurred In  it was occurring in Florida in the continental United States but as of  there were no further locally acquired cases The disease was first identified in  in Tanzania The term is from the Kimakonde language and means "to become contorted"
Around  of people infected with Chikungunya virus experience symptoms typically beginning with a sudden high fever above  °C  °F The fever is soon followed by severe muscle and joint pain Pain usually affects multiple joints in the arms and legs and is symmetric – ie if one elbow is affected the other is as well People with Chikungunya also frequently experience headache back pain nausea and fatigue Around half of those affected develop a rash with reddening and sometimes small bumps on the palms foot soles torso and face For some the rash remains constrained to a small part of the body for others the rash can be extensive covering more than  of the skin Some people experience gastrointestinal issues with abdominal pain and vomiting Others experience eye problems namely sensitivity to light conjunctivitis and pain behind the eye This first set of symptoms – called the "acute phase" of Chikungunya – lasts around a week after which most symptoms resolve on their own
Many people continue to have symptoms after the "acute phase" resolves termed the "postacute phase" for symptoms lasting three weeks to three months and the "chronic stage" for symptoms lasting longer than three months In both cases the lasting symptoms tend to be joint pains arthritis tenosynovitis andor bursitis If the affected person had preexisting joint issues these tend to worsen Overuse of a joint can result in painful swelling stiffness nerve damage and neuropathic pain Typically the joint pain improves with time however the chronic stage can last anywhere from a few months to several years
Joint pain is reported in – of cases and nearly always occurs in more than one joint though joint swelling is uncommon Typically the affected joints are located in both arms and legs Joints are more likely to be affected if they have previously been damaged by disorders such as arthritis Pain most commonly occurs in peripheral joints such as the wrists ankles and joints of the hands and feet as well as some of the larger joints typically the shoulders elbows and knees Pain may also occur in the muscles or ligaments In more than half of cases normal activity is limited by significant fatigue and pain Infrequently inflammation of the eyes may occur in the form of iridocyclitis or uveitis and retinal lesions may occur Temporary damage to the liver may occur
People with Chikungunya occasionally develop neurologic disorders most frequently swelling or degeneration of the brain inflammation or degneration of the myelin sheaths around neurons Guillain–Barré syndrome acute disseminated encephalomyelitis hypotonia in newborns and issues with visual processing In particularly rare cases people may develop behavioral changes seizures irritation of the cerebellum or meninges oculomotor nerve palsy or paralysis of the eye muscles
Newborns are susceptible to particularly severe effects of Chikungunya infection Signs of infection typically begin with fever rash and swelling at the extremities Around half of newborns have a mild case oef the disease that resolves on its own the other half have severe disease with inflammation of the brain and seizures In severe cases affected newborns may also have issues with bleeding and bloodflow and problems with heart function
In addition to newborns the elderly and those with diabetes heart disease liver and kidney diseases and human immunodeficiency virus infection tend to have more severe cases of Chikungunya Around  to  in  people with symptomatic Chikungunya die of the disease
Chikungunya virus CHIKV is a member of the genus Alphavirus and family Togaviridae It was first isolated in  in Tanzania and is an RNA virus with a positivesense singlestranded genome of about kb It is a member of the Semliki Forest virus complex and is closely related to Ross River virus Onyongnyong virus and Semliki Forest virus Because it is transmitted by arthropods namely mosquitoes it can also be referred to as an arbovirus arthropodborne virus In the United States it is classified as a category B priority pathogen and work requires biosafety level III precautions
Chikungunya is generally transmitted from mosquitoes to humans Less common modes of transmission include vertical transmission which is transmission from mother to child during pregnancy or at birth Transmission via infected blood products and through organ donation is also theoretically possible during times of outbreak though no cases have yet been documented The incubation period ranges from one to twelve days and is most typically three to seven
Chikungunya is related to mosquitoes their environments and human behavior The adaptation of mosquitoes to the changing climate of North Africa around  years ago made them seek out environments where humans stored water Human habitation and the mosquitoes environments were then very closely connected During periods of epidemics humans are the reservoir of the virus Because high amounts of virus are present in the blood in the beginning of acute infection the virus can be spread from a viremic human to a mosquito and back to a human During other times monkeys birds and other vertebrates have served as reservoirs Three genotypes of this virus have been described each with a distinct genotype and antigenic character West African EastCentralSouth African and Asian genotypes The Asian lineage originated in  and has subsequently split into two lineages – India Indian Ocean Lineage and South East Asian clades This virus was first reported in the Americas in  Phylogenetic investigations have shown that there are two strains in Brazil – the Asian and EastCentralSouth African types – and that the Asian strain arrived in the Caribbean most likely from Oceania in about March  The rate of molecular evolution was estimated to have a mean rate of  × − substitutions per site per year  higher probability density – × −
Chikungunya is spread through bites from Aedes mosquitoes and the species A aegypti was identified as the most common vector though the virus has recently been associated with many other species including A albopictus Research by the Pasteur Institute in Paris has suggested Chikungunya virus strains in the  Reunion Island outbreak incurred a mutation that facilitated transmission by the Asian tiger mosquito A albopictus Other species potentially able to transmit Chikungunya virus include Ae furcifertaylori Ae africanus and Ae luteocephalus
Chikungunya virus is passed to humans when a bite from an infected mosquito breaks the skin and introduces the virus into the body  The pathogenesis of chikungunya infection in humans is still poorly understood despite recent outbreaks It appears that in vitro Chikungunya virus is able to replicate in human epithelial and endothelial cells primary fibroblasts and monocytederived macrophages Viral replication is highly cytopathic but susceptible to typeI and II interferon In vivo in studies using living cells chikungunya virus appears to replicate in fibroblasts skeletal muscle progenitor cells and myofibers
The type interferon response seems to play an important role in the hosts response to chikungunya infection Upon infection with chikungunya the hosts fibroblasts produce type alpha and beta interferon IFNα and IFNβ In mouse studies deficiencies in INF in mice exposed to the virus cause increased morbidity and mortality The chikungunyaspecific upstream components of the type interferon pathway involved in the hosts response to chikungunya infection are still unknown Nonetheless mouse studies suggest that IPS is an important factor and that IRF and IRF are important in an agedependent manner Mouse studies also suggest that chikungunya evades host defenses and counters the typeI interferon response by producing NS a nonstructural protein that degrades RBP and turns off the host cells ability to transcribe DNA NS interferes with the JAKSTAT signaling pathway and prevents STAT from becoming phosphorylated
In the acute phase of chikungunya the virus is typically present in the areas where symptoms present specifically skeletal muscles and joints In the chronic phase it is suggested that viral persistence the inability of the body to entirely rid itself of the virus lack of clearance of the antigen or both contribute to joint pain The inflammation response during both the acute and chronic phase of the disease results in part from interactions between the virus and monocytes and macrophages Chikungunya virus disease in humans is associated with elevated serum levels of specific cytokines and chemokines High levels of specific cytokines have been linked to more severe acute disease interleukin IL ILβ RANTES monocyte chemoattractant protein  MCP monokine induced by gamma interferon MIG and interferon gammainduced protein  IP Cytokines may also contribute to chronic Chikungunya virus disease as persistent joint pain has been associated with elevated levels of IL and granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor GMCSF In those with chronic symptoms a mild elevation of Creactive protein CRP has been observed suggesting ongoing chronic inflammation However there is little evidence linking chronic Chikungunya virus disease and the development of autoimmunitycitation needed
The virus consists of four nonstructural proteins and three structural proteins The structural proteins are the capsid and two envelope glycoproteins E and E which form heterodimeric spikes on the viron surface E binds to cellular receptors in order to enter the host cell through receptormediated endocytosis E contains a fusion peptide which when exposed to the acidity of the endosome in eukaryotic cells dissociates from E and initiates membrane fusion that allows the release of nucleocapsids into the host cytoplasm promoting infection The mature virion contains  heterodimeric spikes of EE which after release bud on the surface of the infected cell where they are released by exocytosis to infect other cells
Chikungunya is diagnosed on the basis of clinical epidemiological and laboratory criteria Clinically acute onset of high fever and severe joint pain would lead to suspicion of chikungunya Epidemiological criteria consist of whether the individual has traveled to or spent time in an area in which chikungunya is present within the last twelve days ie the potential incubation period Laboratory criteria include a decreased lymphocyte count consistent with viremia However a definitive laboratory diagnosis can be accomplished through viral isolation RTPCR or serological diagnosis
The differential diagnosis may include other mosquitoborne diseases such as dengue or malaria or other infections such as influenza Chronic recurrent polyarthralgia occurs in at least  of chikungunya patients one year after infection whereas such symptoms are uncommon in dengue
Virus isolation provides the most definitive diagnosis but takes one to two weeks for completion and must be carried out in biosafety level III laboratories The technique involves exposing specific cell lines to samples from whole blood and identifying Chikungunya virusspecific responses RTPCR using nested primer pairs is used to amplify several chikungunyaspecific genes from whole blood generating thousands to millions of copies of the genes in order to identify them RTPCR can also be used to quantify the viral load in the blood Using RTPCR diagnostic results can be available in one to two days Serological diagnosis requires a larger amount of blood than the other methods and uses an ELISA assay to measure chikungunyaspecific IgM levels in the blood serum One advantage offered by serological diagnosis is that serum IgM is detectable from  days to months after the onset of symptoms but drawbacks are that results may require two to three days and false positives can occur with infection due to other related viruses such as onyongnyong virus and Semliki Forest virus
Presently there is no specific way to test for chronic signs and symptoms associated with Chikungunya fever although nonspecific laboratory findings such as C reactive protein and elevated cytokines can correlate with disease activity
Because no approved vaccine exists the most effective means of prevention are protection against contact with the diseasecarrying mosquitoes and controlling mosquito populations by limiting their habitat Mosquito control focuses on eliminating the standing water where mosquitos lay eggs and develop as larva if elimination of the standing water is not possible insecticides or biological control agents can be added Methods of protection against contact with mosquitos include using insect repellents with substances such as DEET icaridin PMD pmenthanediol a substance derived from the lemon eucalyptus tree or ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate IR However increasing insecticide resistance presents a challenge to chemical control methodscitation needed
Wearing biteproof long sleeves and trousers also offers protection and garments can be treated with pyrethroids a class of insecticides that often has repellent properties Vaporized pyrethroids for example in mosquito coils are also insect repellents As infected mosquitoes often feed and rest inside homes securing screens on windows and doors will help to keep mosquitoes out of the house In the case of the dayactive A aegypti and A albopictus however this will have only a limited effect since many contacts between the mosquitoes and humans occur outdoorscitation needed
As of update no approved vaccines are available A phaseII vaccine trial used a live attenuated virus to develop viral resistance in  of those tested after  days and  still showed resistance after one year However  of people reported transient joint pain and attenuation was found to be due to only two mutations in the E glycoprotein Alternative vaccine strategies have been developed and show efficacy in mouse models In August  researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the USA were testing an experimental vaccine which uses viruslike particles VLPs instead of attenuated virus  All the  people participated in this phase  trial developed strong immune responses As of  a phase  trial was planned using  adults aged  to  and to take place at  locations in the Caribbean Even with a vaccine mosquito population control and bite prevention will be necessary to control chikungunya disease In  two vaccine manufacturers one in France the other in the United States reported successful completion of Phase II clinical trials
Currently no specific treatment for chikungunya is available Supportive care is recommended and symptomatic treatment of fever and joint swelling includes the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as naproxen nonaspirin analgesics such as paracetamol acetaminophen and fluids Aspirin is not recommended due to the increased risk of bleeding Despite antiinflammatory effects corticosteroids are not recommended during the acute phase of disease as they may cause immunosuppression and worsen infection
Passive immunotherapy has potential benefit in treatment of chikungunya Studies in animals using passive immunotherapy have been effective and clinical studies using passive immunotherapy in those particularly vulnerable to severe infection are currently in progress Passive immunotherapy involves administration of antiCHIKV hyperimmune human intravenous antibodies immunoglobulins to those exposed to a high risk of chikungunya infection No antiviral treatment for Chikungunya virus is currently available though testing has shown several medications to be effective in vitro
In those who have more than two weeks of arthritis ribavirin may be useful The effect of chloroquine is not clear It does not appear to help acute disease but tentative evidence indicates it might help those with chronic arthritis Steroids do not appear to be an effective treatment NSAIDs and simple analgesics can be used to provide partial symptom relief in most cases Methotrexate a drug used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis has been shown to have benefit in treating inflammatory polyarthritis resulting from chikungunya though the drug mechanism for improving viral arthritis is unclear
The mortality rate of chikungunya is slightly less than  in  Those over the age of  neonates and those with underlying chronic medical problems are most likely to have severe complications Neonates are vulnerable as it is possible to vertically transmit chikungunya from mother to infant during delivery which results in high rates of morbidity as infants lack fully developed immune systems The likelihood of prolonged symptoms or chronic joint pain is increased with increased age and prior rheumatological disease
Historically chikungunya has been present mostly in the developing world The disease causes an estimated  million infections each year Epidemics in the Indian Ocean Pacific Islands and in the Americas continue to change the distribution of the disease
In Africa chikungunya is spread by a sylvatic cycle in which the virus largely cycles between other nonhuman primates small mammals and mosquitos between human outbreaks During outbreaks due to the high concentration of virus in the blood of those in the acute phase of infection the virus can circulate from humans to mosquitoes and back to humans The transmission of the pathogen between humans and mosquitoes that exist in urban environments was established on multiple occasions from strains occurring on the eastern half of Africa in nonhuman primate hosts This emergence and spread beyond Africa may have started as early as the th century Currently available data does not indicate whether the introduction of chikungunya into Asia occurred in the th century or more recently but this epidemic Asian strain causes outbreaks in India and continues to circulate in Southeast Asia In Africa outbreaks were typically tied to heavy rainfall causing increased mosquito population In recent outbreaks in urban centers the virus has spread by circulating between humans and mosquitoes
Global rates of chikungunya infection are variable depending on outbreaks When chikungunya was first identified in  it had a lowlevel circulation in West Africa with infection rates linked to rainfall Beginning in the s periodic outbreaks were documented in Asia and Africa However since  following several decades of relative inactivity chikungunya has reemerged and caused large outbreaks in Africa Asia and the Americas In India for instance chikungunya reappeared following  years of absence of viral activity Outbreaks have occurred in Europe the Caribbean and South America areas in which chikungunya was not previously transmitted Local transmission has also occurred in the United States and Australia countries in which the virus was previously unknown In  an outbreak on the island of Réunion was the largest then documented with an estimated  cases on an island with a population of approximately  In a  outbreak India reported  million suspected cases Chikungunya was recently introduced to the Americas and from  to  in the Americas  suspected cases and  confirmed cases were reported by the PAHO
An analysis of the genetic code of Chikungunya virus suggests that the increased severity of the –present outbreak may be due to a change in the genetic sequence which altered the E segment of the virus viral coat protein a variant called EAV This mutation potentially allows the virus to multiply more easily in mosquito cells The change allows the virus to use the Asian tiger mosquito an invasive species as a vector in addition to the more strictly tropical main vector Aedes aegypti Enhanced transmission of Chikungunya virus by A albopictus could mean an increased risk for outbreaks in other areas where the Asian tiger mosquito is present A albopictus is an invasive species which has spread through Europe the Americas the Caribbean Africa and the Middle Eastcitation needed
After the detection of zika virus in Brazil in April  the first ever in the Western Hemisphere it is now thought some chikungunya and dengue cases could in fact be zika virus cases or coinfections
The word chikungunya is believed to have been derived from a description in the Makonde language meaning "that which bends up" of the contorted posture of people affected with the severe joint pain and arthritic symptoms associated with this disease The disease was first described by Marion Robinson and WHR Lumsden in  following an outbreak in  on the Makonde Plateau along the border between Mozambique and Tanganyika the mainland part of modernday Tanzaniacitation needed
According to the initial  report about the epidemiology of the disease the term chikungunya is derived from the Makonde root verb kungunyala meaning to dry up or become contorted In concurrent research Robinson glossed the Makonde term more specifically as "that which bends up" Subsequent authors apparently overlooked the references to the Makonde language and assumed the term to have been derived from Swahili the lingua franca of the region The erroneous attribution to Swahili has been repeated in numerous print sources Many erroneous spellings of the name of the disease are also in common usecitation needed
Since its discovery in Tanganyika Africa in  Chikungunya virus outbreaks have occurred occasionally in Africa South Asia and Southeast Asia but recent outbreaks have spread the disease over a wider rangecitation needed
The first recorded outbreak of this disease may have been in  This is in agreement with the molecular genetics evidence that suggests it evolved around the year 
Chikungunya is one of more than a dozen agents researched as a potential biological weapon
This disease is part of the group of neglected tropical diseases
