Powassan virus POWV is a Flavivirus transmitted by ticks found in North America and in the Russian Far East It is named after the town of Powassan Ontario where it was identified in a young boy who eventually died from it It can cause encephalitis an infection of the brain No approved vaccine or antiviral drug exists Prevention of tick bites is the best precaution
Powassan virus POWV is a Flavivirus named after the town of Powassan Ontario Canadawhere it was identified in a yearold boy who died from encephalitis in  The virus exists in North America and causes longterm neurological sequelae The first human case in the United States was found in  in New Jersey and in Russia in  As of update Powassan virus has been noted as the only tickborne Flavivirus in North America with human pathogenicity
Powassan virus is also found in the warm climate across Eurasia where it is part of the tickborne encephalitis viruscomplex It is found in the Russian Far East Primorsky Krai and appears to have been introduced there  years ago
Powassan virus is an RNA virus split into two separate lineages Lineage I labeled as the prototype lineage and Lineage II the deer tick virus DTV lineage Lineage II has the most genetic variation which indicates that it is most likely the ancestral lineage that split as a result of positive natural selection DTV is very closely related to Powassan virus and a sequence analysis showed that the two viruses diverged about  years ago Even though Lineage II has been predominant in POWV positive tick pools both lineages have had confirmed cases of human disease in North America and Russia The lineages share  nucleotide sequences and  amino acid sequence identity Crossneutralization occurs among flaviviruses due to the conservation of the envelope protein this is what contributes to the fact that the two lineages are serologically indistinguishable As a result the lineages are part of the same viral species
According to the last data evolutionary rate of Powassan virus is  × − nucleotide substitution per site per year  HPD  × −– × − which is significantly lower than values reported in the previous studies The values is compatible with that of tickborne encephalitis virus TBEV and loupingill virus LIV  × −– × − for TBEV and  × −– × − for LIV
The most recent common ancestor of modern POWV split into two independent genetic lineages between  and  years ago probably as a result of the Beringia flood about  thousand years ago
The virus can be transmitted with bites from altogether six known species of ticks the following four species of Ixodes ticks Ixodes cookei Ixodes scapularis Ixodes marxi and Ixodes spinipalpus and the ticks Dermacentor andersoni and Dermacentor variabilis
People with POWV have been mostly confirmed as having one strain of POWV the deer tick virus Ix scapularis is an important vector for the Deer Tick Virus which plays a vital role in maintaining the POWV Ix scapularis is also a primary vector for the agent of Lyme disease because they are generalist feeders and readily bite humans
In Canada and the Northeastern United States Ixodes cookei is the predominant species while Ix scapularis is a significant vector in Minnesota and Wisconsin POWV is transmitted when an infected tick bites a mammal in humans the tick is typically Ix scapularis In North America the lineages of the POWV are maintained in three main enzootic cycles involving three different tick species and their respective small to mediumsized woodland mammals
POWV may infect Ix cookei and woodchucks or it may infect Ix marxi and squirrels and it can cycle between Ix scapularis and whitefooted mice
Based on the time interval for other tickborne diseases like Lyme disease and anaplasmosis the time interval for transmission of POWV is expected to be less than  hours Once the POWV reaches humans it cannot be transmitted to a feeding tick therefore humans are considered "deadend" hosts As of update the fastest transmission time of DTV from a Ix scapularis nymph to a mouse was no more than  minutes
Powassan virus infection is rarely diagnosed as a cause of encephalitis however when it is Powassan encephalitis is severe and neurologic sequelae are common Powassan encephalitis has symptoms compatible with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis oftentimes making it difficult to diagnose Powassan virus encephalitis is a challenge to diagnose because there are only a few laboratories that offer testing the most effective being serologic testing
There are currently no medications or approved vaccines to treat or prevent the POWV People affected by Powassan virus generally first show symptoms  to  weeks after infection The initial symptoms include fever headache nausea occasional confusion and weakness With severe Powassan illnesses the victims should be hospitalized because the symptoms do worsen If not treated symptoms could extend to meningoencephalitis which may include seizures aphasia cranial nerve palsies paresis and altered mental status Currently the best ways to treat POWV illnesses include medications to reduce brain swelling respiratory support and intravenous fluids About  of POWV encephalitis cases are fatal and half the survivors have permanent symptoms that affect their brain There were  confirmed cases of Powassan virus infection in the US between  and 
A rare case of a fivemonthold Connecticut infant boy contracting Powassan virus infection was published in  He survived with normal motor and verbal development on followup at the age of  months but a head MRI showed severely abnormal brain conditions including scarring gliosis and softening encephalomalacia in the thalamus and basal ganglia on both sides and volume loss and early mineralization in the left basal ganglia
On October   former US Senator Kay Hagan died after contracting Powassan virus in  She was  years old
In March  the Connecticut Department of Public Health confirmed that a man aged in his s contracted Powassan virus in the state and was hospitalised with severe neurological symptoms though he was later discharged from hospital to recover at home
Powassan Virus POWV is the only tickborne flavivirus  endemic in North America POWV human illnesses have been reported in the United States Canada and Russia POWV has different genetic variations including deer tick virus DTV which is transmitted by the black legged deer tick Ixodes scapularis It has two distinct lineages POWV lineage I is transmitted by the Ixodes cookei which is endemic in the Great Lakes region of the United States POWV lineage II is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis which is endemic in the Northeast United States Humans can become infected in  minutes after tick attachment
Ixodes ticks have three life stages that require a host larva nymph and adult Each stage requires a blood meal to progress to the next life stage The nymph stage frequently bites humans and is the stage in which I scapularis is most likely to infect a human host with a pathogen The most common reservoir or host for I scapularis are whitefooted mouse and whitetail deer The most common reservoirs for I cookei are skunks woodchucks and squirrels Humans are incidental hosts which means the ticks do not need to feed on humans to survive humans are merely the host they find at the time for their next blood meal
In the US the highest incidence of POWV is in Minnesota and Wisconsin with Massachusetts and New York also having higher incidence than other states in the Great Lakes or Northeast region POWV was included in the list of nationally notifiable diseases to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC in  Between  and   cases of neuroinvasive POWV and  cases of nonneuroinvasive POWV were reported to the CDC Since its discovery in  there have only been  reported human illnesses caused by POWV The incidence rate of POWV in the United States was  case per year from  and has risen to an average of  cases per year since then
Currently POWV is detected with IgM antibody capture ELISA of an IgM immunofluorescence antibody IFA assay plaque reduction neutralization test PRNT detection of virusspecific nucleic acids isolation in culture or a fold increase in antibody titers from paired acute and convalescent sera These specific tests for POWV can only be done at a state lab or the CDC Diagnostic criteria as set by the CDC are resides in an endemic area reported tick exposure and presented with fever altered mental status seizures and focal neurological deficits and blood tissue or cerebrospinal fluid CSF are positive on Powassan IgM or Powassan PRNT tests
Scientists at Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center at The Wistar Institute have designed and tested the firstofitskind synthetic DNA vaccine candidate against Powassan virus POWV targeting portions of the virus envelope protein
