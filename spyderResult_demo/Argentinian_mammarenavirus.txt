Argentinian mammarenavirus better known as the Junin virus or Junín virus JUNV is an arenavirus in the Mammarenavirus genus that causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever AHF The virus took its original name from the city of Junín around which the first cases of infection were reported in 
Argentinian mammarenavirus is a negative sense ssRNA enveloped virion with a variable diameter between  and  nm The surface of the particle encompasses a layer of Tshaped glycoproteins each extending up to  nm outwards from the envelope which are important in mediating attachment and entry into host cells
The Argentinian mammarenavirus genome is composed of two singlestranded RNA molecules each encoding two different genes in an ambisense orientation The two segments are termed short S and long L owing to their respective lengths The short segment around  nucleotides in length encodes the nucleocapsid protein and the glycoprotein precursor GPC The GPC is subsequently cleaved to form two viral glycoproteins GP and GP which ultimately form the Tshaped glycoprotein spike which extends outwards from the viral envelope  The long segment around  nucleotides in length encodes the viral polymerase and a zincbinding protein The virus is spread by rodents
A member of the genus Mammarenavirus Argentinian mammarenavirus characteristically causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever AHF AHF leads to severe compromise of the vascular neurological and immune systems and has a mortality rate between  and  Symptoms of the disease are conjunctivitis purpura petechiae and occasionally sepsis The symptoms of the disease can be confusing the condition can be mistaken for a different one especially during the first week when it can resemble a flu
Since the discovery of Argentinian mammarenavirus in  the geographical distribution of the pathogen although still confined to Argentina has expanded At the time of discovery Argentinian mammarenavirus was confined to an area of around  km² At the beginning of  the region with reported cases grew to around  km² The natural hosts of Argentinian mammarenavirus are rodents particularly Mus musculus Calomys spp and Akodon azarae Direct rodenttohuman transmission only takes place when a person makes direct contact with the excrement of an infected rodent this can occur by ingestion of contaminated food or water inhalation of particles in urine or direct contact of an open wound with rodent feces
An investigational in the US vaccine Candid was developed at the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Disease USAMRIID  at Ft Detrick MD in the s which has shown to be safe well tolerated and effective in reducing mortality and morbidity due to AHF The vaccine which came from an XJ strain of the Argentinian mammarenavirus was continually passaged a total of  times in newborn mouse brains and a total of  times along with cloning in FRhL cells Over  of the volunteers in Phase  and  clinical trials developed antibodies against the Argentinian mammarenavirus and  developed an adequate immune response specific for Argentinian mammarenavirus Moreover a large efficacy study among  people where  individuals were randomly selected to take Candid  and  individuals were randomly selected to take a placebo resulted in  cases of Juninlike infections where  out of the  cases were from the placebo group This efficacy study resulted in a  vaccine efficacy Currently the Candid  vaccine otherwise known as the Junin vaccine is licensed in Argentina by the regulatory agency of Argentina where Argentinian mammarenavirus is endemic to the region People in laboratories who come in constant contact with Argentinian mammarenavirus are also recommended to take the Junin vaccine to prevent transmission
