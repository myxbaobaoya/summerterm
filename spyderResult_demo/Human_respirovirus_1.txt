Human parainfluenza viruses HPIVs are the viruses that cause human parainfluenza HPIVs are a paraphyletic group of four distinct singlestranded RNA viruses belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family These viruses are closely associated with both human and veterinary disease Virions are approximately – nm in size and contain negative sense RNA with a genome encompassing about  nucleotides
The viruses can be detected via cell culture immunofluorescent microscopy and PCR HPIVs remain the second main cause of hospitalisation in children under  years of age suffering from a respiratory illness only Respiratory syncytial virus RSV causes more respiratory hospitalisations for this age group
The first HPIV was discovered in the late s The taxonomic division is broadly based on antigenic and genetic characteristics forming four major serotypes or clades which today are considered distinct viruses These include
HPIVs belong to two genera Respirovirus HPIV  HPIV and Rubulavirus HPIV  HPIV
HPIVs are characterised by producing enveloped virions and containing single stranded negative sense RNA Noninfectious virions have also been reported to contain RNA with positive polarity HPIV genomes are about  nucleotides in length and encode six key structural proteins
The structural gene sequence of HPIVs is as follows ′NPPMFHNL′ the protein prefixes and further details are outlined in the table below
With the advent of reverse genetics it has been found that the most efficient human parainfluenza viruses in terms of replication and transcription have a genome nucleotide total that is divisible by the number  This has led to the "rule of six" being coined Exceptions to this rule have been found and its exact advantages are not fully understood
Electrophoresis has shown that the molecular weight MW of the proteins for the four HPIVs are similar with the exception of the phosphoprotein which shows significant variation
Viral replication is initiated only after successful entry into a cell by attachment and fusion between the virus and the host cell lipid membrane Viral RNA vRNA is initially associated with nucleoprotein NP phosphoprotein P and the large protein L The hemagglutinin–neuraminidase HN is involved with viral attachment and thus hemadsorption and hemagglutination Furthermore the fusion F protein is important in aiding the fusion of the host and viral cellular membranes eventually forming syncytia
Initially the F protein is in an inactive form F but can be cleaved by proteolysis to form its active form F and F linked by disulphide bonds Once complete this is followed by the HPIV nucleocapsid entering the cytoplasm of the cell Subsequently genomic transcription occurs using the viruses own viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase L protein The cells own ribosomes are then tasked with translation forming the viral proteins from the viral mRNA
Towards the end of the process after the formation of the viral proteins the replication of the viral genome occurs Initially this occurs with the formation of a positivesense RNA intermediate step necessary for producing progeny and finally negativesense RNA is formed which is then associated with the nucleoprotein This may then be either packaged and released from the cell by budding or used for subsequent rounds of transcription and replication
The observable and morphological changes that can be seen in infected cells include the enlargement of the cytoplasm decreased mitotic activity and focal rounding with the potential formation of multinucleate cells syncytia
The pathogenicity of HPIVs is mutually dependent on the viruses having the correct accessory proteins that are able to elicit antiinterferon properties This is a major factor in the clinical significance of disease
The main host remains the human However infections have been induced in other animals both under natural and experimental situations although these were always asymptomatic
It is estimated that there are  million children with lower respiratory infections LRI each year in the United States alone  HPIV HPIV and HPIV have been linked with up to a third of these infections  Upper respiratory infections URI are also important in the context of HPIV however they are caused to a lesser extent by the virus The highest rates of serious HPIV illnesses occur among young children and surveys have shown that about  of children aged  or older have antibodies to HPIV
For infants and young children it has been estimated that about  will develop "clinically significant disease"
Repeated infection throughout the life of the host is not uncommon and symptoms of later breakouts include upper respiratory tract illness such as cold and a sore throat The incubation period for all four serotypes is  to  days In immunosuppressed people parainfluenza virus infections can cause severe pneumonia which can be fatal
HPIV and HPIV have been demonstrated to be the principal causative agent behind croup laryngotracheobronchitis which is a viral disease of the upper airway and is mainly problematic in children aged – months of age Biennial epidemics starting in Autumn are associated with both HPIV and  however HPIV can also have yearly outbreaks Additionally HPIV tends to cause biennial outbreaks of croup in the Fall In the United States large peaks have presently been occurring during oddnumbered years
HPIV has been closely associated with bronchiolitis and pneumonia and principally targets those aged  year
HPIV remains infrequently detected However it is now believed to be more common than previously thought but is less likely to cause severe disease By the age of  the majority of children are seropositive for HPIV infection which may be indicative of a large proportion of asymptomatic or mild infections
Important epidemiological factors that are associated with a higher risk of infection and mortality are those who are immunocompromised and may be taken ill with more extreme forms of LRI  Associations between HPIVs and neurologic disease are known for example hospitalisation with certain HPIVs has a strong association with febrile seizures HPIVB has the strongest association up to  followed by HPIV and 
HPIVs have also been linked with rare cases of virally caused meningitis and Guillain–Barré syndrome
HPIVs are spread from person to person horizontal transmission by contact with infected secretions through respiratory droplets or contaminated surfaces or objects Infection can occur when infectious material contacts mucous membranes of the eyes mouth or nose and possibly through the inhalation of droplets generated by a sneeze or cough HPIVs can remain infectious in airborne droplets for over an hour
Overall HPIVs remain best known for its effects on the respiratory system and this appears to be where the majority of the focus has been upon
The inflammation of the airway is a common attribute of HPIV infection It is believed to occur due to the large scale upregulation of inflammatory cytokines Common cytokines expected to be upregulated include IFN–α various other interleukins IL– IL and TNF–α Various chemokines and inflammatory proteins are also believed to be associated with the common symptoms of HPIV infection
Recent evidence seems to suggest that virusspecific antibodies IgE may be responsible for mediating largescale releases of histamine in the trachea which are believed to cause croup More detail on the pathways and interactions can be found here
The bodys primary defense against HPIV infection remains humoral immunity This is mainly directed against surface proteins which can be found on the virus In particular the proteins HN and F prove to be most immunogenic in terms of stimulating the immune system
Recently the importance of the cell mediated immune system has been scrutinized Reports have shown that those with defective adaptive immune responses are at a higher risk of severe infection
Diagnosis can be made in several ways encompassing a range of multifaceted techniques
Because of the similarity in terms of the antigenic profile between the viruses hemagglutination assay HA or hemadsorption inhibition HAdI processes are often used Both complement fixation neutralisation and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays – ELISA can also be used to aid in the process of distinguishing between viral serotypes
Mortality caused by HPIVs in developed regions of the world remains rare Where mortality has occurred it is principally in the three core risk groups very young elderly and immunocompromised Long term changes can however be associated with airway remodelling and are believed to be a significant cause of morbidity  The exact associations between HPIVs and diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD are still being investigated
In developing regions of the world preschool children remain the highest mortality risk group Mortality may be a consequence of primary viral infection or secondary problems such as bacterial infection Predispositions such as malnutrition and other deficiencies may further elevate the chances of mortality associated with infection
Overall LRIs cause approximately – of total deaths in preschool children in the developing world HPIVs is believed to be associated with  of all LRI cases thus remaining a significant cause of mortality
Numerous factors have been suggested and linked to a higher risk of acquiring the infection inclusive of malnutrition vitamin A deficiency absence of breastfeeding during the early stages of life environmental pollution and overcrowding
Despite decades of research no vaccines currently exist
Recombinant technology has however been used to target the formation of vaccines for HPIV  and  and has taken the form of several liveattenuated intranasal vaccines Two vaccines in particular were found to be immunogenic and well tolerated against HPIV in phase I trials HPIV and  vaccine candidates remain less advanced
Vaccine techniques which have been used against HPIVs are not limited to intranasal forms but also viruses attenuated by cold passage host range attenuation chimeric construct vaccines and also introducing mutations with the help of reverse genetics to achieve attenuation
Maternal antibodies may offer some degree of protection against HPIVs during the early stages of life via the colostrum in breast milk
Ribavirin is one medication which has shown good potential for the treatment of HPIV given recent invitro tests invivo tests show mixed results Ribavirin is a broadspectrum antiviral and as of  was being administered to those who are severely immunocompromised despite the lack of conclusive evidence for its benefit Protein inhibitors and novel forms of medication have also been proposed to relieve the symptoms of infection
Furthermore antibiotics may be used if a secondary bacterial infection develops Corticosteroid treatment and nebulizers are also a first line choice against croup if breathing difficulties ensue
Parainfluenza viruses last only a few hours in the environment and are inactivated by soap and water Furthermore the virus can also be easily destroyed using common hygiene techniques and detergents disinfectants and antiseptics
Environmental factors which are important for HPIV survival are pH humidity temperature and the medium within which the virus is found The optimal pH is around the physiologic pH values  to  whilst at high temperatures above  °C and low humidity infectivity reduces
The majority of transmission has been linked to close contact especially in nosocomial infections Chronic care facilities and doctors surgeries are also known to be transmission hotspots with transmission occurring via aerosols large droplets and also fomites contaminated surfaces
The exact infectious dose remains unknown
In economically disadvantaged regions of the world HPIV infection can be measured in terms of mortality In the developed world where mortality remains rare the economic costs of the infection can be estimated Estimates from the US are suggestive of a cost based on extrapolation in the region of  million per annum
