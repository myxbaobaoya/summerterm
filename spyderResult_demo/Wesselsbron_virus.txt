Wesselsbron WSL virus  is an arthropodborne virus in the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae that causes Wesselsbron disease  in cattle sheep goats camels pigs donkeys horses ostriches and wild ruminants with occasional incidental spillover to humans It is transmitted by mosquitoes in the genus Aedes including A caballus and A circumluteolus

The first known outbreak was reported in  on a sheep farm in the town of Wesselsbrons in Orange Free State Province South Africa after an increase of lamb deaths and ewe abortions  Since the flock had been vaccinated  weeks before for protection against the Rift Valley virus the possibility of a "new" disease was not put into consideration the vaccine was assumed to be the culprit Although they both share similarities the WSL virus was isolated as distinct from the Rift Valley virus after the examination of a dead lambs liver and brain
Since  WSL virus has been found in animals and mosquitos from Zimbabwe Uganda Kenya Nigeria Central African Republic Senegal Cameroon and Ivory Coast Serologic evidence has also shown the virus to be present in Mozambique Botswana Namibia Angola and Madagascar  Outside of Africa WSL virus has been found in Thailand
Although it can infect a wide variety of animals WSL virus is most commonly found in sheep 
In newborn lambs death may occur within  hours following an incubation period of – days Signs of illness which include but are not limited to fever anorexia listlessness weakness and increased respiration can often go undetected because they are not specific to any disease Pregnant ewes generally suffer from abortions but rams and nonpregnant ewes usually only develop a fever There is no specific treatment for the virus but sheep can be immunized with an attenuated vaccine that lasts a lifetime
Most documented human infections have been acquired by field workers bitten by mosquitoes or in the laboratory PersontoPerson transmission of the virus has yet to be reported so it is not considered to be contagious in humans The WSL virus has an incubation period of – days before leading to a sudden onset of a generally mild acute phase that includes fever rigors headache myalgia arthralgia and impaired vision
