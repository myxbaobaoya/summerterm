Sin Nombre orthohantavirus SNV from Spanish meaning "without a name" is the prototypical etiologic agent of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome HCPS
Discovered in  near the Ca√±on de la Muerte on the Navajo Reservation it was originally named the Muerto Canyon hantavirus in keeping with the convention for naming new pathogens However the Navajo Nation objected to the name in  It was also near the Four Corners point in the United States so the virologists then tried naming it the "Four Corners virus" The name was changed after local residents raised objections In frustration the virologists changed it to Sin Nombre meaning "without a name" in Spanish
It was first isolated in  from rodents collected near the home of one of the initial patients with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome HPS in the Four Corners region of the western United States Isolation was achieved through blind passage in Peromyscus maniculatus deer mouse and subsequent adaptation to growth in Vero E cells Additional viral strains have also been isolated from P maniculatus associated with a fatal case in California and P leucopus from the vicinity of probable infection of a New York case Black Creek Canal virus was isolated from S hispidus collected near the residence of a human case in Dade County Florida Another etiologic agent of HCPS Bayou virus was first isolated from the vicinity of Monroe Louisiana
SNV occurs wherever its reservoir rodent carrier the deer mouse Peromyscus maniculatus is found which includes essentially the entire populated area of North America except for the far southeastern region from eastern Texas through Florida Alaska and the far northern reaches of Canada SNV and HCPS are especially common in western states peak incidences for HCPS have been reported in regions in which there is a lot of contact between humans and mice New Mexico Arizona and in states with exceptionally large rural populations such as California All of the western provinces of Canada have also reported cases SNV can be contracted through the inhalation of viruscontaminated deer mouse excretacitation needed
The case fatality ratio of SNVinduced HCPS in the USA was reported to be about  CDC   However since that time the case fatality ratio has steadily declined as more mild cases came to be recognized By  the CFR had declined to about citation needed
The entire genomic sequence of SNV has subsequently been determined by using RNA extracted from autopsy material as well as RNA extracted from cell cultureadapted virus The L RNA is  nucleotides nt in length the M RNA is  nt long and the S RNA is  to  nt long When the prototype sequence NMH of SNV detected in tissues from an HPS case was compared with the sequence of the SNV isolate NMR isolated in Vero E cells from Peromyscus maniculatus trapped in the residence of the same case only  nucleotide changes were found and none of these changes resulted in alterations in amino acid sequences of viral proteins It had been assumed that in the process of adaptation to cell culture selection of SNV variants which grow optimally in cell culture would occur and selected variants would differ genetically from the parental virus Though NMH and NMR are identical in protein sequence nucleotide substitutions in nontranslated regions of the genome could be responsible for altered viral phenotypes as could changes in protein glycosylation or virus membrane componentscitation needed
The nested RTPCR assay developed during the initial HCPS outbreak provided a rapid method for the genetic characterization of novel hantaviruses that did not require a virus isolate Numerous new hantaviruses have been detected by RTPCR in rodent tissues but have yet to be associated with human disease These include El Moro Canyon virus associated with the western harvest mouse Reithrodontomys megalotis Tula virus with Microtus arvalis and M rossiaemeridionalis Rio Segundo virus with the Mexican harvest mouse R mexicanus Isla Vista virus with the California vole M californicus and Prospect Hilllike viruses in Microtus speciescitation needed
