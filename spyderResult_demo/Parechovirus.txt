Parechovirus is a genus of viruses in the family Picornaviridae Humans ferrets and various rodents serve as natural hosts The genus currently consists of six accepted species Human parechoviruses may cause gastrointestinal or respiratory illness in infants and they have been implicated in cases of myocarditis and encephalitis
Eighteen types of human parechovirus have been identified human parechovirus  HPeV formerly echovirus  human parechovirus  formerly echovirus  and HPeV to HPeV A total of  genotypes are currently recognised
The ICTV recognises the following six species
An additional two species are recognised by Picornaviridaecom but not by the ICTV
Parechoviruses are nonenveloped with icosahedral spherical and round geometries and Tpseudo symmetry The diameter is around Â nm Genomes are linear and nonsegmented around kb in length
Viral replication is cytoplasmic Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the virus to host receptors which mediates endocytosis Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model Positive stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of transcription The virus exits the host cell by lysis and viroporins
Human parechoviruses cause mild gastrointestinal or respiratory illness but have been implicated in cases of myocarditis and encephalitis Human parechoviruses are commonly spread and more than  of human cases are infected early in life within two to five years of age Parechovirus B has been proposed as a zoonotic virus associated with diabetes and intrauterine fetal death in humans However the data regarding these features are currently limited and need to be confirmed Parechovirus is a Biosafety Level  organism
The first parechoviruses E and E were isolated in  and recognized as a new genus in  Parechovirus B was first isolated from bank voles Myodes glareolus formerly Clethrionomys glareolus in the mids Human parechovirus type  HPeV was found in at least  US young infants in  Those numbers include a set of identical triplets from central Wisconsin who contracted the virus and were diagnosed nearly two months later after a flurry of tests as this was the first known case in those health systems The  outbreak is a higher number than expected and is thought to be linked to maternalfetal transmission
