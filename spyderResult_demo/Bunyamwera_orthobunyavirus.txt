Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus BUNV is a negativesense singlestranded enveloped RNA virus It is assigned to the Orthobunyavirus genus in the Bunyavirales order
Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus can infect both humans and Aedes aegypti yellow fever mosquito
It is named for Bunyamwera a town in western Uganda where it was isolated in  Reassortant viruses derived from Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus such as Ngari virus have been associated with large outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fever in Kenya and Somalia
The genetic structure of Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus is typical for Bunyavirales viruses which are an order of enveloped negativesense singlestranded RNA viruses with a genome split into three partsSmall S Middle M and Large L The L RNA segment encodes an RNAdependent RNA polymerase L protein the M RNA segment encodes two surface glycoproteins Gc and Gn and a nonstructural protein NSm while the S RNA segment encodes a nucleocapsid protein N and in an alternative overlapping reading frame a second nonstructural protein NSs The genomic RNA segments are encapsidated by copies of the N protein in the form of ribonucleoprotein RNP complexes The N protein is the most abundant protein in virus particles and infected cells and therefore the main target in many serological and molecular diagnostics
In humans Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus causes Bunyamwera fever
