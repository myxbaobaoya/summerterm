The rhinovirus from the Ancient Greek ῥίς romanized rhis "nose" mwparseroutput spansmallcapsfontvariantsmallcapsmwparseroutput spansmallcapssmallerfontsizegen ῥινός romanized rhinos "of the nose" and the Latin vīrus is the most common viral infectious agent in humans and is the predominant cause of the common cold Rhinovirus infection proliferates in temperatures of – °C – °F the temperatures found in the nose Rhinoviruses belong to the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae
The three species of rhinovirus A B and C include around  recognized types of human rhinovirus that differ according to their surface proteins serotypes They are lytic in nature and are among the smallest viruses with diameters of about  nanometers By comparison other viruses such as smallpox and vaccinia are around ten times larger at about  nanometers while flu viruses are around – nm
In  when a cluster of nurses developed a mild respiratory illness Winston Price from the Johns Hopkins University took nasal passage samples and isolated the first rhinovirus which he called the JH virus named after Johns Hopkins His findings were published in 
There are two modes of transmission via aerosols of respiratory droplets and from fomites contaminated surfaces including direct persontoperson contact
Rhinoviruses are spread across the world and are the primary cause of the common cold Symptoms include sore throat runny nose nasal congestion sneezing and cough sometimes accompanied by muscle aches fatigue malaise headache muscle weakness or loss of appetite Most sinus findings are reversible consistent with a selflimited viral process typical of rhinovirus colds Fever and extreme exhaustion are more usual in influenza Children may have six to twelve colds a year In the United States the incidence of colds is higher in the autumn and winter with most infections occurring between September to April The seasonality may be due to the start of the school yearcitation needed and to people spending more time indoors thereby increasing the chance of transmission of the virus Lower ambient temperatures especially outdoors may also be a factor given that rhinoviruses preferentially replicate at  °C  °F as opposed to  °C  °F Variant pollens grasses hays and agricultural practices may be factors in the seasonality as well as the use of chemical controls of lawn paddock and sportsfields in schools and communities The changes in temperature humidity and wind patterns seem to be factors It is also postulated that poor housing overcrowding and unsanitary conditions related to poverty are relevant factors in the transmission of common cold
Those most affected by rhinoviruses are infants the elderly and immunocompromised people
The primary route of entry for human rhinoviruses is the upper respiratory tract mouth and nose Rhinovirus A and B use "major" ICAM InterCellular Adhesion Molecule  also known as CD Cluster of Differentiation  on respiratory epithelial cells as receptors to bind to Some subgroups under A and B uses the "minor" LDL receptor instead Rhinovirus C uses cadherinrelated family member  CDHR to mediate cellular entry As the virus replicates and spreads infected cells release distress signals known as chemokines and cytokines which in turn activate inflammatory mediators Cell lysis occurs at the upper respiratory epithelium
Infection occurs rapidly with the virus adhering to surface receptors within  minutes of entering the respiratory tract Just over  of individuals will experience symptoms within  days of infection Only about  of cases will have an incubation period of less than  hours and at the other extreme it is expected that  of cases would have an incubation period of greater than four and a half days
Human rhinoviruses preferentially grow at  °C  °F notably colder than the average human body temperature of  °C  °F hence the viruss tendency to infect the upper respiratory tract where respiratory airflow is in continual contact with the colder extrasomatic environment
Rhinovirus C unlike the A and B species may be able to cause severe infections This association disappears after controlling for confounders Duly amongst infants infected with symptomatic respiratory illness in lowresource areas there appears to be no association between rhinovirus species and disease severity
Rhinovirus was formerly classified as a genus of the family Picornaviridae The th Executive Committee EC of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ICTV met in Canada during June  with new taxonomic proposals In April  the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses voted and ratified the following changes
The merge is based on the grounds that the two "genera" of viruses are not significantly different in a virological sense They have identical genome organizations and particle structures and the phylogeny is not always monophyletic
In July  the ICTV voted and ratified a proposal to add a third species Human rhinovirus C to the genus Enterovirus
There have been a total of  taxonomic proposals which have been approved and ratified since the th ICTV Report of 
Human rhinovirus serotype names are of the form HRVXn where X is the rhinovirus species A B or C and n is an index number Species A and B have used the same index while Species C has a separate index Valid index numbers are as follows
Rhinoviruses have singlestranded positive sense RNA genomes of between  and  nt in length At the  end of the genome is a virusencoded protein and as in mammalian mRNA there is a  polyA tail Structural proteins are encoded in the  region of the genome and non structural at the  end This is the same for all picornaviruses The viral particles themselves are not enveloped and are dodecahedral in structure
The viral proteins are translated as a single long polypeptide which is cleaved into the structural and nonstructural viral proteins
Human rhinoviruses are composed of a capsid that contains four viral proteins VP VP VP and VP VP VP and VP form the major part of the protein capsid The much smaller VP protein has a more extended structure and lies at the interface between the capsid and the RNA genome There are  copies of each of these proteins assembled as an icosahedron Antibodies are a major defense against infection with the epitopes lying on the exterior regions of VPVP
Interferonalpha used intranasally was shown to be effective against human rhinovirus infections However volunteers treated with this drug experienced some side effects such as nasal bleeding and began developing tolerance to the drug Subsequently research into the treatment was abandoned
Pleconaril is an orally bioavailable antiviral drug being developed for the treatment of infections caused by picornaviruses This drug acts by binding to a hydrophobic pocket in VP and stabilizes the protein capsid to such an extent that the virus cannot release its RNA genome into the target cell When tested in volunteers during the clinical trials this drug caused a significant decrease in mucus secretions and illnessassociated symptoms Pleconaril is not currently available for treatment of human rhinoviral infections as its efficacy in treating these infections is under further evaluation
Other substances such as IotaCarrageenan may form a basis for the creation of drugs to combat the human rhinovirus
In asthma human rhinoviruses have been recently associated with the majority of asthma exacerbations for which current therapy is inadequate Intercellular adhesion molecule  ICAM has a central role in airway inflammation in asthma and it is the receptor for  of Human rhinoviruses Human rhinovirus infection of airway epithelium induces ICAM
Desloratadine and loratadine are compounds belonging to the new class of Hreceptor blockers Antiinflammatory properties of antihistamines have been recently documented although the underlying molecular mechanisms are not completely defined These effects are unlikely to be mediated by Hreceptor antagonism and suggest a novel mechanism of action that may be important for the therapeutic control of virusinduced asthma exacerbationscitation needed
In  a new series of antirhinoviral compounds were reported by researchers at Imperial College London and colleagues at the University of York and the Pirbright Institute These molecules target human Nmyristoyltransferase an enzyme in the host cell which picornavirus requires in order to assemble its viral capsid and thus generate an infectious virion The lead compound in this series IMP very potently inhibited host myristoylation of viral capsid protein and prevented infectious virus formation rescuing the viability of cells in culture which had been exposed to a variety of rhinovirus serotypes or to related picornaviruses including poliovirus and footandmouthdisease virus Because these compounds target a host factor they are broadly active against all serotypes and it is thought to be unlikely that they can be overcome by resistance mutations in the virus
There are no vaccines against these viruses as there is littletono crossprotection between serotypes At least  serotypes of human rhinoviruses affecting humans have been sequenced However a study of the VP protein has shown it to be highly conserved among many serotypes of human rhinovirus opening up the potential for a future panserotype human rhinovirus vaccine A similar result was obtained with the VP protein Like VP VP also occasionally "pokes" out of the viral particle making it available to neutralizing antibodies Both peptides have been tested on rabbits resulting in successful generation of crossserotype antibodies
The successful introduction of human ICAM into mice has removed a major roadblock in creating an animal model for RV vaccination
Human rhinovirus can remain activated for up to three hours outside of a human host Once the virus is contracted a person is most contagious within the first three days Preventative measures such as regular vigorous handwashing with soap and water may aid in avoiding infection Avoiding touching the mouth eyes and nose the most common entry points for rhinovirus may also aid in prevention Droplet precautions which take the form of a surgical mask and gloves are the method used in major hospitals
