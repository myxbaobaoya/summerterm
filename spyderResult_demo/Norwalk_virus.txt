Norovirus sometimes referred to as the winter vomiting bug is the most common cause of gastroenteritis Infection is characterized by nonbloody diarrhea vomiting and stomach pain Fever or headaches may also occur Symptoms usually develop  to  hours after being exposed and recovery typically occurs within one to three days Complications are uncommon but may include dehydration especially in the young the old and those with other health problems
The virus is usually spread by the fecal–oral route This may be through contaminated food or water or persontoperson contact It may also spread via contaminated surfaces or through air from the vomit of an infected person Risk factors include unsanitary food preparation and sharing close quarters Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms Confirmatory testing is not usually available but may be performed by public health agencies during outbreaks
Prevention involves proper hand washing and disinfection of contaminated surfaces There is no vaccine or specific treatment for norovirus Management involves supportive care such as drinking sufficient fluids or intravenous fluids Oral rehydration solutions are the preferred fluids to drink although other drinks without caffeine or alcohol can help Alcoholbased hand sanitizers are not effective against the norovirus according to the NHS information page on the subject this is due to norovirus being a nonenveloped virus
Norovirus results in about  million cases of disease and  deaths globally a year It is common both in the developed and developing world Those under the age of five are most often affected and in this group it results in about  deaths in the developing world Norovirus infections occur more commonly during winter months It often occurs in outbreaks especially among those living in close quarters In the United States it is the cause of about half of all foodborne disease outbreaks The virus is named after the city of Norwalk Ohio where an outbreak occurred in 
Norovirus infection is characterized by nausea vomiting watery diarrhea abdominal pain and in some cases loss of taste A person usually develops symptoms of gastroenteritis  to  hours after being exposed to norovirus General lethargy weakness muscle aches headaches and lowgrade fevers may occur The disease is usually selflimiting and severe illness is rare Although having norovirus can be unpleasant it is not usually dangerous and most who contract it make a full recovery within two to three days
Norovirus can establish a long term infection in people who are immunocompromised such as those with common variable immunodeficiency or with a suppressed immune system after organ transplantation These infections can be with or without symptoms In severe cases persistent infections can lead to norovirus‐associated enteropathy intestinal villous atrophy and malabsorption
Noroviruses are transmitted directly from person to person – of all reported outbreaks and indirectly via contaminated water and food They are extremely contagious and fewer than twenty virus particles can cause an infection some research suggests as few as five Transmission can be aerosolized when those stricken with the illness vomit and can be aerosolized by a toilet flush when vomit or diarrhea is present infection can follow eating food or breathing air near an episode of vomiting even if cleaned up The viruses continue to be shed after symptoms have subsided and shedding can still be detected many weeks after infection
Vomiting in particular transmits infection effectively and appears to allow airborne transmission In one incident a person who vomited spread infection across a restaurant suggesting that many unexplained cases of food poisoning may have their source in vomit In December   people were dining at six tables one person vomited onto the floor Staff quickly cleaned up and people continued eating Three days later others started falling ill  people reported a range of symptoms from fever and nausea to vomiting and diarrhea The cause was not immediately identified Researchers plotted the seating arrangement more than  of the people at the same table as the sick person later reported becoming ill There was a direct correlation between the risk of infection of people at other tables and how close they were to the sick person More than  of the diners at an adjacent table fell ill at a table on the other side of the restaurant the infection rate was still  The outbreak was attributed to a Norwalklike virus norovirus Other cases of transmission by vomit were later identified
In one outbreak at an international scout jamboree in the Netherlands each person with gastroenteritis infected an average of  people before increased hygiene measures were put in place Even after these new measures were enacted an ill person still infected an average of  other people A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC study of  outbreaks in New York State lists the suspected mode of transmission as persontoperson in seven outbreaks foodborne in two waterborne in one and one unknown The source of waterborne outbreaks may include water from municipal supplies wells recreational lakes swimming pools and ice machines
Shellfish and salad ingredients are the foods most often implicated in norovirus outbreaks Ingestion of shellfish that has not been sufficiently heated – under  °C  °F – poses a high risk for norovirus infection Foods other than shellfish may be contaminated by infected food handlers Many norovirus outbreaks have been traced to food that was handled by only one infected person
Between March and August  in Quebec Canada there was an outbreak of norovirus that sickened more than  people According to an investigation by Canadas CFIA Food Control Agency the culprit was frozen raspberries imported from Harbin Gaotai Food Co Ltd a Chinese supplier and then Canadian authorities issued a recall on raspberries products from Harbin Gaotai 
Noroviruses NoV are a genetically diverse group of singlestranded positivesense RNA nonenveloped viruses belonging to the family Caliciviridae According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses the genus Norovirus has one species which is called Norwalk virus
Noroviruses can genetically be classified into at least seven different genogroups GI GII GIII GIV GV GVI and GVII which can be further divided into different genetic clusters or genotypes
Noroviruses commonly isolated in cases of acute gastroenteritis belong to two genogroups genogroup I GI includes Norwalk virus Desert Shield virus and Southampton virus and II GII which includes Bristol virus Lordsdale virus Toronto virus Mexico virus Hawaii virus and Snow Mountain virus
Most noroviruses that infect humans belong to genogroups GI and GII
Noroviruses from genogroup II genotype  abbreviated as GII account for the majority of adult outbreaks of gastroenteritis and often sweep across the globe
Recent examples include USUS strain associated with global outbreaks in the mid to lates Farmington Hills virus associated with outbreaks in Europe and the United States in  and in  and Hunter virus which was associated with outbreaks in Europe Japan and Australasia In  there was another large increase in NoV infection around the globe Reports have shown a link between the expression of human histoblood group antigens HBGAs and the susceptibility to norovirus infection Studies have suggested the capsid of noroviruses may have evolved from selective pressure of human HBGAs HBGAs are not however the receptor or facilitator of norovirus infection In fact cofactors such as bile salts may facilitate the infection making it more intense when introduced during or after the initial infection of the host tissue  Bile salts are produced by the liver in response to eating fatty foods and they help with the absorption of consumed lipids It is not yet clear as to at what specific point in the Norovirus replication cycle bile salts facilitate infection penetration uncoating or maintaining capsid stability
The protein MDA may be the primary immune sensor that detects the presence of noroviruses in the body  Some people have common variations of the MDA gene that could make them more susceptible to norovirus infection
Viruses in Norovirus are nonenveloped with icosahedral geometries Capsid diameters vary widely from  to  nm in diameter The larger capsids – nm exhibit T symmetry and are composed of  VP proteins Small capsids  nm show T symmetry and are composed of  VP proteins The virus particles demonstrate an amorphous surface structure when visualized using electron microscopy
Noroviruses contain a linear nonsegmented positivesense RNA genome of approximately  kilobases encoding a large polyprotein which is cleaved into six smaller nonstructural proteins NS to NS by the viral Clike protease NS a major structural protein VP of about  kDa and a minor capsid protein VP
The most variable region of the viral capsid is the P domain which contains antigenpresenting sites and carbohydratereceptor binding regions
Groups    and  last shared a common ancestor in AD  The group  and group  viruses last shared a common ancestor in approximately AD   highest posterior density – AD Several estimates of the evolution rate have been made varying from  × − to  × − substitutions per site per year
The estimated mutation rate ×− to  ×− substitutions per site per year in this virus is high even compared with other RNA viruses
In addition a recombination hotspot exists at the ORFORF VP junction
Viral replication is cytoplasmic Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment to host receptors which mediates endocytosis Positivestranded RNA virus transcription is the method of replication Translation takes place by leaky scanning and RNA terminationreinitiation Humans and other mammals serve as the natural host Transmission routes are fecaloral and contamination
When a person becomes infected with norovirus the virus replicates within the small intestine The principal symptom is acute gastroenteritis characterized by nausea forceful vomiting watery diarrhea and abdominal pain that develops between  and  hours after exposure and lasts for – hours Sometimes there is loss of taste general lethargy weakness muscle aches headache cough andor lowgrade fever The disease is usually selflimiting
Severe illness is rare although people are frequently treated at the emergency ward they are rarely admitted to the hospital The number of deaths from norovirus in the United States is estimated to be around – each year with most of these occurring in the very young the elderly and persons with weakened immune systems Symptoms may become lifethreatening in these groups if dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is ignored or not treated
Specific diagnosis of norovirus is routinely made by polymerase chain reaction PCR assays or quantitative PCR assays which give results within a few hours These assays are very sensitive and can detect as few as  virus particles 
Tests such as ELISA that use antibodies against a mixture of norovirus strains are available commercially but lack specificity and sensitivity
After infection immunity to the same strain of the virus – the genotype – protects against reinfection for between  months to  years This immunity does not fully protect against infection with the other diverse genotypes of the virus
In Canada norovirus is a notifiable disease In both the US and the UK it is not notifiable
Hand washing with soap and water is an effective method for reducing the transmission of norovirus pathogens Alcohol rubs ≥ isopropyl alcohol may be used as an adjunct but are less effective than handwashing as norovirus lacks a lipid viral envelope Surfaces where norovirus particles may be present can be sanitised with a solution of  to  of household bleach in water or other disinfectants effective against norovirus
In healthcare environments the prevention of nosocomial infections involves routine and terminal cleaning Nonflammable alcohol vapor in CO systems is used in health care environments where medical electronics would be adversely affected by aerosolized chlorine or other caustic compounds
In  the CDC published a clinical practice guideline addressing strategies for the prevention and control of norovirus gastroenteritis outbreaks in healthcare settings Based on a systematic review of published scientific studies the guideline presents  specific evidencebased recommendations which were organized into  categories  patient cohorting and isolation precautions  hand hygiene  patient transfer and ward closure  food handlers in healthcare  diagnostics  personal protective equipment  environmental cleaning  staff leave and policy  visitors  education  active casefinding and  communication and notification The guideline also identifies eight highpriority recommendations and suggests several areas in need of future research
LigoCyte announced in  that it was working on a vaccine and had started phase  trials The company has since been taken over by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company As of update a bivalent NoV GIGII intramuscular vaccine had completed phase  trials In  the phase b trials were finished The vaccine relies on using a viruslike particle that is made of the norovirus capsid proteins in order to mimic the external structure of the virus Since there is no RNA in this particle it is incapable of reproducing and cannot cause an infection
The norovirus can survive for long periods outside a human host depending on the surface and temperature conditions  it can survive for weeks on hard and soft surfaces and it can survive for months maybe even years in contaminated still water A  study found the virus remained on surfaces used for food preparation seven days after contamination
Routine protocols to detect norovirus in clams and oysters by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction are being employed by governmental laboratories such as the Food and Drug Administration FDA in the US
There is no specific medicine to treat people with norovirus illness Norovirus infection cannot be treated with antibiotics because it is a virus Treatments aim to avoid complications by measures such as the management of dehydration caused by fluid loss in vomiting and diarrhea and to mitigate symptoms using antiemetics and antidiarrheals
Norovirus causes about  of all cases of acute gastroenteritis worldwide It is relatively common in developed countries and in lowmortality developing countries  and  respectively compared to highmortality developing countries  Proportionately it causes more illness in people in the community or in hospital outpatients  and  respectively as compared with hospital inpatients  in whom other causes are more common
Age and emergence of new norovirus strains do not appear to affect the proportion of gastroenteritis attributable to norovirus
Norovirus is a common cause of epidemics of gastroenteritis on cruise ships The CDC through its Vessel Sanitation Program records and investigates outbreaks of gastrointestinal illnessmostly caused by noroviruson cruise ships with both a US and foreign itinerary there were  in  and  from  January to  May  An outbreak may affect over  of passengers and a smaller proportion of crew members
Epidemiological studies have shown that individuals with different ABOH histoblood group phenotypes are infected with NoV strains in a genotypespecific manner GII includes global epidemic strains and binds to more histoblood group antigens than other genogroups FUT fucosyltransferase transfers a fucose sugar to the end of the ABOH precursor in gastrointestinal cells and saliva glands The ABHantigen produced is thought to act as a receptor for human norovirus A nonfunctional fucosyltransferase FUT provides high protection from the most common norovirus strain GII
Homozygous carriers of any nonsense mutation in the FUT gene are called nonsecretors as no ABHantigen is produced Approximately  of Caucasians are nonsecretors due to GA and CT nonsense mutations in FUT and therefore have strong – although not absolute – protection from the norovirus GII Nonsecretors can still produce ABH antigens in erythrocytes as the precursor is formed by FUT Some norovirus genotypes GI can infect nonsecretors
The norovirus was originally named the "Norwalk agent" after Norwalk Ohio in the United States where an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis occurred among children at Bronson Elementary School in November  although an outbreak had already been discovered in  in Roskilde Denmark where it is commonly known as "Roskilde syge" or "Roskilde illness" In  electron microscopy on stored human stool samples identified a virus which was given the name "Norwalk virus" Numerous outbreaks with similar symptoms have been reported since The cloning and sequencing of the Norwalk virus genome showed that these viruses have a genomic organization consistent with viruses belonging to the family Caliciviridae The name "norovirus" Norovirus for the genus was approved by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ICTV in  In  however a press release and a newsletter were published by ICTV which strongly encouraged the media national health authorities and the scientific community to use the virus name Norwalk virus rather than the genus name Norovirus when referring to outbreaks of the disease This was also a public response by ICTV to the request from an individual in Japan to rename the Norovirus genus because of the possibility of negative associations for people in Japan and elsewhere who have the family name "Noro" Before this position of ICTV was made public ICTV consulted widely with members of the Caliciviridae Study Group and carefully discussed the case
In addition to "Norwalk agent" and "Norwalk virus" the virus has also been called "Norwalklike virus" "small roundstructured viruses" SRSVs Spencer flu and "Snow Mountain virus" Common names of the illness caused by noroviruses still in use include "Roskilde illness" "winter vomiting disease" "winter vomiting bug" "viral gastroenteritis" and "acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis" It also colloquially is known as "stomach flu" but this actually is a broad name that refers to gastric inflammation caused by a range of viruses and bacteria
