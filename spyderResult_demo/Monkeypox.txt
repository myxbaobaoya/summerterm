Monkeypox is an infectious viral disease that can occur in both humans and some other animals Early symptoms include fever headache muscle pains shivering backache and feeling extremely tired Typically there are swollen lymph nodes behind the ear below the jaw in the neck or in the groin This is followed by a rash that forms blisters and crusts over most frequently in the mouth on the face hands and feet genitals and eyes The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is on average  days though ranges from to days The duration of symptoms is typically two to four weeks Cases may be severe especially in children pregnant women or people with suppressed immune systems
Monkeypox may be spread from handling bushmeat an animal bite or scratch body fluids contaminated objects or close contact with an infected person The virus normally circulates among certain rodents Diagnosis can be confirmed by testing a lesion for the viruss DNA The disease can appear similar to chickenpox
The smallpox vaccine can prevent infection with  effectiveness but smallpox vaccination stopped in most parts of the world in the late s resulting in very little immunity against monkeypox In  a monkeypox vaccine Jynneos was approved for adults in the United States The current standard for treatment is tecovirimat an antiviral that is specifically intended to treat infections with orthopoxviruses such as smallpox and monkeypox It is approved for the treatment of monkeypox in the European Union and the United States Cidofovir or brincidofovir may also be useful Reports of the risk of death if untreated are as high as  to  in the Congo Basin Central African clade of monkeypox
Monkeypox was first identified in  among laboratory monkeys in Copenhagen Denmark Monkeys are not a natural reservoir of the virus The first cases in humans were found in  in the Democratic Republic of the Congo An outbreak that occurred in the United States in  was traced to a pet store where rodents imported from Ghana were sold The  monkeypox outbreak represents the first incidence of widespread community transmission outside of Africa which began in the United Kingdom in May  with subsequent cases confirmed in at least  countries in Europe North America South America Asia North Africa and Australia
Monkeypox is a zoonotic poxvirus infection that can occur in both humans and some other animals Two recognised distinct types are described as the Congo Basin clade and the milder West African clade
Early symptoms include headache muscle pains fever and fatigue It may initially appear like flu The disease can resemble chickenpox measles and smallpox but is distinguished by the presence of swollen glands These characteristically appear behind the ear below the jaw in the neck or in the groin before the onset of the rash Within a few days of the fever lesions characteristically appear on the face before appearing elsewhere such as palms of the hands and soles of the feet in a centrifugal distribution 
Threequarters of affected people have lesions on the palms and soles more than twothirds in the mouth a third on the genitals and one in five have lesions in the eyes They begin as small flat spots before becoming small bumps which then fill with at first clear fluid and then yellow fluid which subsequently burst and scab over There may be a few lesions or several thousand sometimes merging to produce large lesions 
In each part of the body affected the lesions evolve in the same stage It looks identical to the rash of smallpox The rash typically lasts around days An affected person may remain unwell for two to four weeks After healing the lesions may leave pale marks before becoming dark scars
Limited persontoperson spread of infection has been reported in diseaseendemic areas in Africa
Complications include secondary infections pneumonia sepsis encephalitis and loss of vision if severe eye infection If infection occurs during pregnancy still birth or birth defects may occur The disease may be milder in people vaccinated against smallpox in childhood
Monkeypox in both humans and animals is caused by infection with the monkeypox virus – a doublestranded DNA virus in the genus Orthopoxvirus family Poxviridae The virus is found mainly in tropical rainforest regions of Central and West Africa The virus is split into Congo Basin and West African clades matching the geographical areas
Most human cases of monkeypox are acquired from an infected animal though the route of transmission remains unknown The virus is thought to enter the body through broken skin the respiratory tract or the mucous membranes of the eyes nose or mouth  Once a human is infected transmission to other humans is common with family members and hospital staff at particularly high risk of infection
Humantohuman transmission is thought to occur primarily through close contact with an infected subject There are indications that transmission occurs during sexual intercourse Animaltohuman transmission may occur by bite or scratch bush meat preparation direct contact with body fluids or lesion material or indirect contact with lesion material such as through contaminated bedding
Humans can be infected by an animal via a bite or by direct contact with an infected animals bodily fluids The virus can also spread from human to human by respiratory airborne contact or by contact with an infected persons bodily fluids Risk factors for transmission include sharing a bed or room or using the same utensils as an infected person Increased transmission risk is associated with factors involving the introduction of virus to the oral mucosa 
Monkeypox symptoms tend to begin  to  days after infection Further research about the transmission of the strain responsible for the  outbreak is ongoing but it is not thought to be different to other strains of the West African clade
In addition to monkeys the virus is found in Gambian pouched rats Cricetomys gambianus dormice Graphiurus spp and African squirrels Heliosciurus and Funisciurus The use of these animals as food may be an important source of transmission to humans
No specific reservoir for monkeypox has been found Monkeys are not a main reservoir contrary to the name It is believed African rodents such as the ones listed above serve as the actual reservoir
Clinical differential diagnosis must consider other rash illnesses such as chickenpox measles bacterial skin infections scabies syphilis and medicationassociated allergies Lymphadenopathy during the prodromal stage of illness can distinguish monkeypox from chickenpox or smallpox Diagnosis can be verified by testing for the virus
Polymerase chain reaction PCR testing of samples from skin lesions is the preferred laboratory test PCR blood tests are usually inconclusive because the virus does not remain very long in the blood To interpret test results information is required on date of onset of fever date of onset of rash date of specimen collection current stage of rash and patient age
Vaccination against smallpox is assumed to provide protection against human monkeypox infection because they are closely related viruses and the vaccine protects animals from experimental lethal monkeypox challenges This has not been conclusively demonstrated in humans because routine smallpox vaccination was discontinued following the eradication of smallpox
Smallpox vaccine has been reported to reduce the risk of monkeypox among previously vaccinated persons in Africa The decrease in immunity to poxviruses in exposed populations is a factor in the prevalence of monkeypox It is attributed both to waning crossprotective immunity among those vaccinated before  when mass smallpox vaccinations were discontinued and to the gradually increasing proportion of unvaccinated individuals 
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC recommends that persons investigating monkeypox outbreaks and involved in caring for infected individuals or animals should receive a smallpox vaccination to protect against monkeypox Persons who have had close or intimate contact with individuals or animals confirmed to have monkeypox should also be vaccinated
The CDC does not recommend preexposure vaccination for unexposed veterinarians veterinary staff or animal control officers unless such persons are involved in field investigations
The CDC recommends that healthcare providers don a full set of personal protective equipment PPE before caring for an infected person This includes a gown mask goggles and a filtering disposable respirator such as an N An infected person should be isolated in preferably a negative air pressure room or at least a private exam room to keep others from possible contact
In the European Union and the United States tecovirimat is approved for the treatment of several poxviruses including monkeypox BMJ Best Practice recommends tecovirimat or the smallpox treatment brincidofovir as the first line antiviral treatment if required alongside supportive care including antipyretic fluid balance and oxygenation Empirical antibiotic therapy or aciclovir may be used if secondary bacterial or varicella zoster infection is suspected respectively
Monkeypox as a disease in humans was first associated with an illness in the Democratic Republic of the Congo formerly Zaire in the town of Basankusu Équateur Province in  WHO surveillance between  and  in DRCZaire recorded  confirmed cases and  deaths CFR  A second outbreak of human illness was identified in DRCZaire in –  cases were reported in DRCZaire between  and  The Congo Basin clade of disease remains endemic in DRC and has a high CFR
The other genetic clade of MPXV occurs in Western Africa The case fatality rate CFR is less than  No humantohuman transmission was documented until the  monkeypox outbreak in Europe The West African clade had an outbreak – the first outbreak of monkeypox outside of Africa – in Midwestern United States among owners of pet prairie dogs in  Seventyone people were reportedly infected of whom none died
Monkeypox is traditionally restricted to the ecology of tropical rainforests The pattern was broken in  when  cases were reported in Sudan areas now South Sudan with no fatalities The genetic analysis suggests that the virus did not originate in Sudan but was imported most likely from DRC
Many more monkeypox cases have been reported in Central and West Africa and in the Democratic Republic of Congo in particular  cases per year are known between  and  The collected data is often incomplete and unconfirmed which hinders realistic estimations of the number of cases of monkeypox over time Nevertheless it was suggested that the number of reported monkeypox cases had increased and the geographical occurrence broadened as of 
In May  a young child became ill with fever and rash after being bitten by a prairie dog purchased at a local swap meet near Milwaukee Wisconsin In total  cases of monkeypox were reported through June   All cases were traced to Gambian pouched rats imported from Accra Ghana in April  by a Texas exotic animal distributor No deaths resulted Electron microscopy and serologic studies were used to confirm that the disease was human monkeypox
People with monkeypox typically experienced prodromal symptoms of fever headaches muscle aches chills and drenching sweats Roughly onethird of infected people had nonproductive coughs This prodromal phase was followed – days later by the development of a papular rash that typically progressed through stages of vesiculation pustulation umbilication and crusting In some people early lesions had become ulcerated
Rash distribution and lesions occurred on head trunk and extremities Many of the people had initial and satellite lesions on palms soles and extremities Rashes were generalized in some people After onset of the rash people generally manifested rash lesions in different stages Everyone affected reported direct or close contact with prairie dogs later found to be infected with the monkeypox virus
Monkeypox has been reportedly spread around southeast and south Nigeria Some states and the federal government of Nigeria are currently seeking a way to contain it as well as find a cure for the infected ones It has spread to Akwa Ibom Abia Bayelsa Benue Cross River Delta Edo Ekiti Enugu Imo Lagos Nasarawa Oyo Plateau Rivers and Federal Capital Territory The outbreak started in September  and remained ongoing across multiple states as of May 
According to information provided by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control between  and   human Monkeypox infections were reported in the country In September  human monkeypox reemerged in Nigeria after  years when it was last reported The  human monkeypox outbreak in the country was large Bayelsa state was the first state in Nigeria to have reported the  outbreak Unlike previous reports of the West African clade the outbreak was characterized by infection predominantly among young male adults with significant transmission to others The Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital reported that a substantial number of its young adult cases had concomitant genital ulcers syphilis and HIV infection The CDC has reported cases of American travelers contracting Monkeypox upon return from Lagos and Ibadan Agam Rao a medical officer in the Division of Pathogens and High Consequence Pathology at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that since  all cases reported outside Africa have come from Nigeria
In an article published by The Conversation Oyewale Tomori pointed out that the number of Monkeypox infections in Nigeria through  is likely to be underrepresented because much of the Nigerian population has been avoiding healthcare facilities due to fear of contracting COVID
As British health authorities reported the first case of Monkeypox in the UK in May  the Nigerian government has released to the public information and statistics on reported cases and deaths in the country In a report released on May   the NCDC states that  cases were confirmed across  states and the Federal Capital Territory between  and  In  NCDC has implemented National Technical Working Group abbreviated as NTWG for the purpose of reporting and monitoring infections in addition to strengthening response capacity In the NCDC report Rivers State was the most affected by Monkeypox followed by Bayelsa and Lagos In the span from  to  the NCDC reported  deaths in  different states making for a  Case Fatality Ratio
In September  the United Kingdoms first case of monkeypox was recorded The person a Nigerian national is believed to have contracted monkeypox in Nigeria before travelling to the United Kingdom According to Public Health England the person was staying in a naval base in Cornwall before being moved to the Royal Free Hospitals specialised infectious disease unit People who had been in contact with the person since he contracted the disease were contacted 
A second case was confirmed in the town of Blackpool with a further case that of a medical worker who cared for the case from Blackpool A fourth case occurred on  December  when monkeypox was diagnosed in a person in south west England They were travelling to the UK from Nigeria
On  May  a yearold man who travelled from Nigeria was hospitalised in an isolation ward at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in Singapore after being confirmed as the countrys first case of monkeypox As a result  people were quarantined The case may have been linked to a simultaneous outbreak in Nigeria
On  May in the UK three cases of monkeypox from a single household were identified by Public Health Wales The cases were also announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock while addressing MPs The index case was diagnosed on  May after traveling from Nigeria The second case was reported on  June and the third on  June One of the three patients an adult female was treated with tecovirimat On day  of tecovirimat she was discharged from hospital to complete her second week of treatment at home
On  July in the US an American returning from a trip in Nigeria was diagnosed with monkeypox Subsequent testing identified the virus as belonging to the West African clade The patient was hospitalized and treated with tecovirimat and was discharged after  days at which time monkeypox virus DNA could no longer be detected in residual skin lesions
An ongoing outbreak of monkeypox was confirmed  May  beginning with a cluster of cases found in the United Kingdom The first recognised case was confirmed on  May  in an individual with travel links to Nigeria where the disease is endemic
but it has been suggested that cases were already spreading in Europe in the previous months From  May onwards cases were reported from an increasing number of countries and regions predominantly in Europe but also in North and South America Asia North Africa and Australia  cases had been confirmed as of  June
Monkeypox was first identified in laboratory cynomolgus monkeys in Denmark by Preben von Magnus in  when two outbreaks of a smallpoxlike disease occurred in colonies of monkeys captured in Malaysia and transported via Singapore An outbreak of monkeypox at Rotterdam Zoo was reported in  Subsequently monkeypox was detected in several laboratory monkeys in the US No further cases in laboratory monkeys occurred after  as conditions for monkeys improved and the requirement for monkeys used mainly for producing the polio vaccine from Asia and Africa fell The virus was never found in Asia and the occurrence in Asian monkeys was likely due to contracting the disease in captivity and transit or contamination 
The first documented case in humans was in  in an unvaccinated month old boy in the Équateur Province Democratic Republic of the Congo formerly Zaire  Almost  cases were reported between  and  with more than two thirds of these being from Zaire The other cases originated from Liberia Nigeria Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone By  over  cases in humans were reported Small viral outbreaks with a death rate in the range of  and a secondary humantohuman infection rate of about the same amount occur routinely in equatorial Central and West Africa
Signs and symptoms in animals vary among different species Monkeypox infected Gambian pouched rats may have mild symptoms During the  US outbreak affected prairie dogs presented with fever cough sore eyes poor feeding and rash Nonhuman primates present similarly They may have breathing problems facial swelling mouth ulcers and swollen glands In cynomolgus monkeys the time from exposure to symptoms was noted to be around a week Rabbits and rodents typically present with fever cough runny nose sore eyes and swollen glands They develop small bumps that fill with yellow fluid and may have patches of hair loss and pneumonia The disease has also been reported in dormice tree squirrels and rope squirrels Other animals are likely susceptible but not known
Spread among animals occurs via the fecaloral route and through the nose through wounds and eating infected meat Death is more likely in baby monkeys The CDC recommend that animals exposed to monkeypox be quarantined for six weeks
