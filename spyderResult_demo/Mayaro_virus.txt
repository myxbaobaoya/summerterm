Mayaro virus disease is a mosquitoborne zoonotic pathogen endemic to certain humid forests of tropical South America  Infection with Mayaro virus causes an acute selflimited denguelike illness of – days duration The causative virus abbreviated MAYV is in the family Togaviridae and genus Alphavirus  It is closely related to other alphaviruses that produce a denguelike illness accompanied by longlasting arthralgia  It is only known to circulate in tropical South America
Mayaro virus has a structure similar to other alphaviruses It is an enveloped virus and has an icosahedral capsid with a diameter of  nm The virus genome is composed of a linear positivesense singlestranded RNA with  nucleotides excluding the  cap nucleotide and  polyA tail
The MAYV RNA genome contains the  untranslated region  noncoding region and two open reading frames ORFs The  proximal and  proximal ORFs are separated by a short noncoding sequence and represent twothirds and onethird of the genomic RNA respectively The proximal ORF codes for a polyprotein that after cleavage forms nonstructural proteins nsP nsP nsP nsP and the proximal ORF with a S promoter codes for a polyprotein that is cleaved into structural proteins to generate capsid proteins and envelope surface glycoproteins E E E C K
The nonstructural proteins nsP play different functions in the virus cycle The nsP is an mRNAcapping enzyme nsP has protease activity and nsP is a RNAdirect RNA polymerase The structural polyprotein is cleaved into six chains capsid protein C p E protein or spike glycoprotein E E envelope glycoprotein or spike glycoprotein E K protein and E envelope glycoprotein known also as spike glycoprotein E The envelope lipid component is critical for virus particle stability and infectivity in mammalian cells Once the virus enters into the host cell the genomic RNA is released into the cytoplasm where the two ORFs are translated into proteins and the synthesis of negativestranded RNA starts A consecutive synthesis of positivestranded RNA takes place
The MAYV sequences analysis showed two genotypes D and L The amplicon used for phylogenetic analysis includes E and E glycoprotein genes and the  NCR The genotype D is distributed in Trinidad Brazil French Guiana Surinam Peru and Bolivia while the genotype L is limited to the northcentral region of Brazil
The MAYV infection is characterized by fever headache myalgia rash prominent pain in the large joints and association with rheumatic disease but these signs and symptoms are unspecific to distinguish from other arboviruses The MAYV infection can be confirmed by laboratory testing such as virus isolation RTPCR and serology The virus isolation in cell culture is effective during viremia RTPCR helps to identify virus Serology tests detect antibodies like IgM and the most common assay is IgMcapture enzymelinked immunosorbant assays ELISA This test usually requires a consecutive retest to confirm increasing titers While the IgG detection is applied for epidemiology studies
The viruss transmission cycle in the wild is similar to the continuous sylvatic cycle of yellow fever and is believed to involve wild primates monkeys as the natural reservoir and the tree canopydwelling Haemagogus species mosquito as the vector  Human infections are strongly associated with exposure to humid tropical forest environments Chikungunya virus is closely related producing a nearly indistinguishable highly debilitating arthralgic disease 
On February   a Portugueselanguage news source reported on a recent survey that revealed Mayaro virus activity in Manaus Amazonas State Brazil  The survey studied blood samples from  residents of Manaus who had experienced a high fever Mayaro virus was identified in  cases  Four of the cases experienced mild hemorrhagic bleeding symptoms which had not previously been described in Mayaro virus disease  The report stated that this outbreak is the first detected in a metropolitan setting and expressed concern that the disease might be adapting to urban species of mosquito vectors which would make it a risk for spreading within the country  
A study published in  demonstrated that a colonized strain of Brazilian Aedes albopictus was capable of acquiring MAYV from infected hamsters and subsequently transmitting it and another study demonstrated that A aegypti can  transmit MAYV supporting the possibility of wider transmission of Mayaro virus disease in urban settings
A  study demonstrated that A aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus were inefficient MAYV vectors but Anopheles freeborni Anopheles gambiae Anopheles quadrimaculatus and Anopheles stephensi were able to transmit MAYV with three of the four capable of transmitting two genotypes  The tested Anopheles species are native to Africa Asia and North America suggesting that Anopheles spp could play a significant role in the dissemination and establishment of MAYV in diverse regions of the world
An outbreak in Chuquisaca Department Bolivia involving  persons was reported in May 
In January  a French tourist developed highgrade fever and severe joint pain manifestations following a day trip in the Amazon basin Brazil and was diagnosed with MAYV infection in France This case is the first reported in a traveler returning from an endemic South American country to Europe  Mayaro virus disease has also been transported into the United States by two visitors infected in eastern Peru and into the Netherlands by a couple infected while vacationing in Surinam
The first outbreak of Mayaro virus disease in humans in Venezuela was reported in early June  with  cases diagnosed in Ospino Portuguesa state and an additional two in San Fernando de Apure Apure state on  June  for a total of  reported cases as of  June
A single case of Mayaro virus in a child in Haiti in  has been confirmed
In  cases were reported in Peru and Ecuador
Research has suggested that macrophage migration inhibitory factor plays a critical role in determining the clinical severity of alphavirusinduced musculoskeletal disease and may provide a target for development of antiviral pharmaceuticals for Mayaro virus and other alphaviruses that affect human beings such as Ross River virus chikungunya Sindbis virus and Onyongnyong virus
