Lassa mammarenavirus LASV is an arenavirus that causes Lassa hemorrhagic fever
a type of viral hemorrhagic fever VHF in humans and other primates Lassa mammarenavirus is an emerging virus and a select agent requiring Biosafety Level equivalent containment It is endemic in West African countries especially Sierra Leone the Republic of Guinea Nigeria and Liberia where the annual incidence of infection is between  and  cases resulting in  deaths per year
As of  discoveries within the Mano River region of west Africa have expanded the endemic zone between the two known Lassa endemic regions indicating that LASV is more widely distributed throughout the tropical wooded savannah ecozone in west Africa There are no approved vaccines against Lassa fever for use in humans
In  missionary nurse Laura Wine fell ill with a mysterious disease she contracted from an obstetrical patient in Lassa a village in Borno State Nigeria She was then transported to Jos where she died Subsequently two others became infected one of whom was fiftytwoyearold nurse Lily Pinneo who had cared for Laura Wine Samples from Pinneo were sent to Yale University in New Haven where a new virus that would later be known as Lassa mammarenavirus was isolated for the first time by Jordi Casals Sonja Buckley and others Casals contracted the fever and nearly lost his life one technician died from it By  the multimammate rat Mastomys natalensis was found to be the main reservoir of the virus in West Africa able to shed virus in its urine and feces without exhibiting visible symptoms
Lassa viruses are enveloped singlestranded bisegmented ambisense RNA viruses Their genome is contained in two RNA segments that code for two proteins each one in each sense for a total of four viral proteins
The large segment encodes a small zinc finger protein Z that regulates transcription and replication
and the RNA polymerase L The small segment encodes the nucleoprotein NP and the surface glycoprotein precursor GP also known as the viral spike which is proteolytically cleaved into the envelope glycoproteins GP and GP that bind to the alphadystroglycan receptor and mediate host cell entry
Lassa fever causes hemorrhagic fever frequently shown by immunosuppression Lassa mammarenavirus replicates very rapidly and demonstrates temporal control in replication The first replication step is transcription of mRNA copies of the negative or minussense genome This ensures an adequate supply of viral proteins for subsequent steps of replication as the NP and L proteins are translated from the mRNA The positive or plussense genome then makes viral complementary RNA vcRNA copies of itself The RNA copies are a template for producing negativesense progeny but mRNA is also synthesized from it The mRNA synthesized from vcRNA are translated to make the GP and Z proteins This temporal control allows the spike proteins to be produced last and therefore delay recognition by the host immune system
Nucleotide studies of the genome have shown that Lassa has four lineages three found in Nigeria and the fourth in Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone The Nigerian strains seem likely to have been ancestral to the others but additional work is required to confirm this
Lassa mammarenavirus gains entry into the host cell by means of the cellsurface receptor the alphadystroglycan alphaDG a versatile receptor for proteins of the extracellular matrix It shares this receptor with the prototypic Old World arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus Receptor recognition depends on a specific sugar modification of alphadystroglycan by a group of glycosyltransferases known as the LARGE proteins Specific variants of the genes encoding these proteins appear to be under positive selection in West Africa where Lassa is endemic Alphadystroglycan is also used as a receptor by viruses of the New World clade C arenaviruses Oliveros and Latino viruses In contrast the New World arenaviruses of clades A and B which include the important viruses Machupo Guanarito Junin and Sabia in addition to the non pathogenic Amapari virus use the transferrin receptor  A small aliphatic amino acid at the GP glycoprotein amino acid position  is required for highaffinity binding to alphaDG In addition GP amino acid position  also appears to be important since all arenaviruses showing highaffinity alphaDG binding possess a bulky aromatic amino acid tyrosine or phenylalanine at this positioncitation needed
Unlike most enveloped viruses which use clathrin coated pits for cellular entry and bind to their receptors in a pH dependent fashion Lassa and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus instead use an endocytotic pathway independent of clathrin caveolin dynamin and actin Once within the cell the viruses are rapidly delivered to endosomes via vesicular trafficking albeit one that is largely independent of the small GTPases Rab and Rab On contact with the endosome pHdependent membrane fusion occurs mediated by the envelope glycoprotein which at the lower pH of the endosome binds the lysosome protein LAMP which results in membrane fusion and escape from the endosome
The life cycle of Lassa mammarenavirus is similar to the Old World arenaviruses Lassa mammarenavirus enters the cell by the receptormediated endocytosis Which endocytotic pathway is used is not known yet but at least the cellular entry is sensitive to cholesterol depletion It was reported that virus internalization is limited upon cholesterol depletion The receptor used for cell entry is alphadystroglycan a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed cell surface receptor for extracellular matrix proteins Dystroglycan which is later cleaved into alphadystroglycan and betadystroglycan is originally expressed in most cells to mature tissues and it provides molecular link between the ECM and the actinbased cytoskeleton After the virus enters the cell by alphadystroglycan mediated endocytosis the lowpH environment triggers pHdependent membrane fusion and releases RNP viral ribonucleoprotein complex into the cytoplasm Viral RNA is unpacked and replication and transcription initiate in the cytoplasm As replication starts both S and L RNA genomes synthesize the antigenomic S and L RNAs and from the antigenomic RNAs genomic S and L RNA are synthesized Both genomic and antigenomic RNAs are needed for transcription and translation The S RNA encodes GP and NP viral nucleocapsid protein proteins while L RNA encodes Z and L proteins The L protein most likely represents the viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase When the cell is infected by the virus L polymerase is associated with the viral RNP and initiates the transcription of the genomic RNA The  and  terminal  nt viral promoter regions of both RNA segments are necessary for recognition and binding of the viral polymerase The primary transcription first transcribes mRNAs from the genomic S and L RNAs which code NP and L proteins respectively Transcription terminates at the stemloop SL structure within the intergenomic region Arenaviruses use a cap snatching strategy to gain the cap structures from the cellular mRNAs and it is mediated by the endonuclease activity of the L polymerase and the cap binding activity of NP Antigenomic RNA transcribes viral genes GPC and Z encoded in genomic orientation from S and L segments respectively The antigenomic RNA also serves as the template for the replication After translation of GPC it is posttranslationally modified in the endoplasmic reticulum GPC is cleaved into GP and GP at the later stage of the secretory pathway It has been reported that the cellular protease SKISP is responsible for this cleavage The cleaved glycoproteins are incorporated into the virion envelope when the virus buds and release from the cell membrane
Lassa fever is mostly caused by the Lassa mammarenavirus The symptoms include flulike illness characterized by fever general weakness cough sore throat headache and gastrointestinal manifestations Hemorrhagic manifestations include vascular permeability
Upon entry the Lassa mammarenavirus infects almost every tissue in the human body It starts with the mucosa intestine lungs and urinary system and then progresses to the vascular system
The main targets of the virus are antigenpresenting cells mainly dendritic cells and endothelial cells
In  it was reported how Lassa mammarenavirus nucleoprotein NP sabotages the hosts innate immune system response Generally when a pathogen enters into a host innate defense system recognizes the pathogenassociated molecular patterns PAMP and activates an immune response One of the mechanisms detects double stranded RNA dsRNA which is only synthesized by negativesense viruses In the cytoplasm dsRNA receptors such as RIGI retinoic acidinducible gene I and MDA melanoma differentiation associated gene  detect dsRNAs and initiate signaling pathways that translocate IRF interferon regulatory factor  and other transcription factors to the nucleus Translocated transcription factors activate expression of interferons ùõÇ and ùõÉ and these initiate adaptive immunity NP encoded in Lassa mammarenavirus is essential in viral replication and transcription but it also suppresses host innate IFN response by inhibiting translocation of IRF NP of Lassa mammarenavirus is reported to have an exonuclease activity to only dsRNAs the NP dsRNA exonuclease activity counteracts IFN responses by digesting the PAMPs thus allowing the virus to evade host immune responses
