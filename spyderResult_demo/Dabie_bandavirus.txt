Dabie bandavirus also called SFTS virus is a tickborne virus in the genus Bandavirus in the family Phenuiviridae order Bunyavirales The clinical condition it caused is known as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome SFTS SFTS is an emerging infectious disease that was first described in northeast and central China  and now has also been discovered in Japan South Korea Vietnam and Taiwan in  SFTS has a fatality rate of  and as high as over  in some areas The major clinical symptoms of SFTS are fever vomiting diarrhea multiple organ failure thrombocytopenia low platelet count leukopenia low white blood cell count and elevated liver enzyme levels Another outbreak occurred in East China in the early half of 
In  Xuejie Yu and colleagues isolated the SFTS virus SFTSV from SFTS patients blood
The genome has been sequenced There are three segmentslarge L medium M and small S Five proteins have been identifiedan RNA dependent RNA polymerase RdRp a glycoprotein N Gn a glycoprotein C Gc a nuclear protein NP and a non structural protein NSs
The L segment encodes the RNA polymerase with  amino acid residues
The M segment encodes one open reading frame encoding  amino acid precursors of glycoproteins Gn and Gc
The S segment has  nucleotides of ambisense RNA encoding two proteins the N and NSs proteins These lie in opposite orientations and are separated by a  nucleotide intergenic region
Five genotypes A–E have been identified Strains from China could be grouped into all five genotypes while isolates from South Korea lay in three types A D and E and those from Japan only in one type E The virus appears to have originated in the Dabie Mountains in central China between  and 
Among bunyaviruses it appears to be more closely related to the Uukuniemi virus serogroup than to the Sandfly fever group It is a member of the Bhanja virus serocomplex
SFTSV is a tickborne virus it is not clear whether it can be transmitted by other bloodsucking arthropods It can infect many mammalian hosts including cats mice hedgehogs weasels brushtail possums and yaks Humans appear to be accidental hosts and play no essential role in the life cycle of SFTSV SFTSV has been detected from the ixodid tick Haemaphysalis longicornis Ixodes nipponensis Amblyomma testudinarium and Rhipicephalus microplus In addition to tick bite SFTSV can be transmitted from person to person through contact with blood or mucus of an infected person
This virus has been found in the Chinese provinces of Anhui Henan Hubei Jiangsu Liaoning and Shandong SFTS occurs in rural areas from March to November and a majority of cases are found from April to July
The virus has also been found in South Korea Japan Vietnam and Taiwan
