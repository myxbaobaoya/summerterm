Rotavirus is a genus of doublestranded RNA viruses in the family Reoviridae Rotaviruses are the most common cause of diarrhoeal disease among infants and young children Nearly every child in the world is infected with a rotavirus at least once by the age of five Immunity develops with each infection so subsequent infections are less severe Adults are rarely affected  There are nine species of the genus referred to as A B C D F G H I and J Rotavirus A the most common species causes more than  of rotavirus infections in humans 
The virus is transmitted by the faecaloral route It infects and damages the cells that line the small intestine and causes gastroenteritis which is often called "stomach flu" despite having no relation to influenza Although Rotavirus was discovered in  by Ruth Bishop and her colleagues by electron micrograph images and accounts for approximately one third of hospitalisations for severe diarrhoea in infants and children its importance has historically been underestimated within the public health community particularly in developing countries In addition to its impact on human health rotavirus also infects other animals and is a pathogen of livestock
Rotaviral enteritis is usually an easily managed disease of childhood but in  rotaviruses caused  percent of  deaths of children from diarrhoea and  deaths worldwide and almost two million more became severely ill Most of these deaths occurred in developing countries  In the United States before initiation of the rotavirus vaccination programme in the s rotavirus caused about  million cases of severe gastroenteritis in children almost  hospitalisations and around  deaths each year Following rotavirus vaccine introduction in the United States hospitalisation rates have fallen significantly Public health campaigns to combat rotavirus focus on providing oral rehydration therapy for infected children and vaccination to prevent the disease The incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have added rotavirus vaccine to their routine childhood immunisation policies
There are nine species of rotavirus referred to as A B C D F G H I and J  Humans are primarily infected by the species rotavirus A A–I species cause disease in other animals species  H in pigs D F and G in birds I in cats and J in bats
Within rotavirus A there are different strains called serotypes As with influenza virus a dual classification system is used based on two  proteins on the surface of the virus The glycoprotein VP defines the G serotypes and the proteasesensitive protein VP defines P serotypes Because the two genes that determine Gtypes and Ptypes can be passed on separately to progeny viruses different combinations are found A whole genome genotyping system has  been established for rotavirus A which has been used to determine the origin of atypical strains The prevalence of the individual Gtypes and Ptypes varies between and within countries and years There are at least  G types and  P types but in infections of humans only a few combinations of G and P types predominate They are GP GP GP GP GP and GP
The genome of rotaviruses consists of  unique double helix molecules of RNA dsRNA which are  nucleotides in total Each helix or segment is a gene numbered  to  by decreasing size Each gene codes for one protein except genes  which codes for two The RNA is surrounded by a threelayered icosahedral protein capsid Viral particles are up to  nm in diameter and are not enveloped
There are six viral proteins VPs that form the virus particle virion These structural proteins are called VP VP VP VP VP and VP In addition to the VPs there are six nonstructural proteins NSPs that are only produced in cells infected by rotavirus These are called NSP NSP NSP NSP NSP and NSP
At least six of the twelve proteins encoded by the rotavirus genome bind RNA The role of these proteins play in rotavirus replication is not entirely understood their functions are thought to be related to RNA synthesis and packaging in the virion mRNA transport to the site of genome replication and mRNA translation and regulation of gene expression
VP is located in the core of the virus particle and is an RNAdependent RNA polymerase enzyme In an infected cell this enzyme produces mRNA transcripts for the synthesis of viral proteins and produces copies of the rotavirus genome RNA segments for newly produced virus particles
VP forms the core layer of the virion and binds the RNA genome
VP is part of the inner core of the virion and is an enzyme called guanylyl transferase This is a capping enzyme that catalyses the formation of the  cap in the posttranscriptional modification of mRNA The cap stabilises viral mRNA by protecting it from nucleic acid degrading enzymes called nucleases
VP is on the surface of the virion that protrudes as a spike It binds to molecules on the surface of cells called receptors and drives the entry of the virus into the cell VP has to be modified by the protease enzyme trypsin which is found in the gut into VP and VP before the virus is infectious VP determines how virulent the virus is and it determines the Ptype of the virus In humans there is an association between the blood group  Lewis antigen system ABO blood group system
and secretor status and susceptibility to infection Nonsecretors seem resistant to infection by types P and P indicating that blood group antigens are the receptors for these genotypes This resistance is dependent on the rotavirus genotype
VP forms the bulk of the capsid It is highly antigenic and can be used to identify rotavirus species This protein is used in laboratory tests for rotavirus A infections
VP is a glycoprotein that forms the outer surface of the virion Apart from its structural functions it determines the Gtype of the strain and along with VP is involved in immunity to infection
NSP the product of gene  is a nonstructural RNAbinding protein  NSP also blocks the interferon response the part of the innate immune system that protects cells from viral infection  NSP causes the proteosome to degrade key signaling components required to stimulate production of interferon in an infected cell and to respond to interferon secreted by adjacent cells  Targets for degradation include several IRF transcription factors required for interferon gene transcription
NSP is an RNAbinding protein that accumulates in cytoplasmic inclusions viroplasms and is required for genome replication
NSP is bound to viral mRNAs in infected cells and it is responsible for the shutdown of cellular protein synthesis NSP inactivates two translation initiation factors essential for synthesis of proteins from host mRNA  First NSP ejects polyAbinding protein PABP from the translation initiation factor eIFF  PABP is required for efficient translation of transcripts with a  polyA tail which is found on most host cell transcripts  Second NSP inactivates eIF by stimulating its phosphorylation Efficient translation of rotavirus mRNA which lacks the  polyA tail does not require either of these factors
NSP is a viral enterotoxin that induces diarrhoea and was the first viral enterotoxin discovered
NSP is encoded by genome segment  of rotavirus A In virusinfected cells NSP accumulates in the viroplasm
NSP is a nucleic acid binding protein and is encoded by gene  from an outofphase open reading frame
This table is based on the simian rotavirus strain SA RNAprotein coding assignments differ in some strains
The attachment of the virus to the host cell is initiated by VP which attaches to molecules called glycans on the surface of the cell The virus enters cells by receptor mediated endocytosis and form a vesicle known as an endosome Proteins in the third layer VP and the VP spike disrupt the membrane of the endosome creating a difference in the calcium concentration This causes the breakdown of VP trimers into single protein subunits leaving the VP and VP protein coats around the viral dsRNA forming a doublelayered particle DLP
The eleven dsRNA strands remain within the protection of the two protein shells and the viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase creates mRNA transcripts of the doublestranded viral genome By remaining in the core the viral RNA evades innate host immune responses including RNA interference that are triggered by the presence of doublestranded RNA
During the infection rotaviruses produce mRNA for both protein biosynthesis and gene replication Most of the rotavirus proteins accumulate in viroplasm where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled In the viroplasm the positive sense viral RNAs that are used as templates for the synthesis of viral genomic dsRNA are protected from siRNAinduced RNase degradation Viroplasm is formed around the cell nucleus as early as two hours after virus infection and consists of viral factories thought to be made by two viral nonstructural proteins NSP and NSP Inhibition of NSP by RNA interference in vitro results in a sharp decrease in rotavirus replication The DLPs migrate to the endoplasmic reticulum where they obtain their third outer layer formed by VP and VP The progeny viruses are released from the cell by lysis
Rotaviruses are transmitted by the fæcaloral route via contact with contaminated hands surfaces and objects and possibly by the respiratory route Viral diarrhoea is highly contagious The faeces of an infected person can contain more than  trillion infectious particles per gram  fewer than  of these are required to transmit infection to another person
Rotaviruses are stable in the environment and have been found in estuary samples at levels up to – infectious particles per US gallon The viruses survive between  and  days Sanitary measures adequate for eliminating bacteria and parasites seem to be ineffective in control of rotavirus as the incidence of rotavirus infection in countries with high and low health standards is similar
Rotaviral enteritis is a mild to severe disease characterised by nausea vomiting watery diarrhoea and lowgrade fever Once a child is infected by the virus there is an incubation period of about two days before symptoms appear The period of illness is acute Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea Dehydration is more common in rotavirus infection than in most of those caused by bacterial pathogens and is the most common cause of death related to rotavirus infection
Rotavirus A infections can occur throughout life the first usually produces symptoms but subsequent infections are typically mild or asymptomatic as the immune system provides some protection Consequently symptomatic infection rates are highest in children under two years of age and decrease progressively towards  years of age The most severe symptoms tend to occur in children six months to two years of age the elderly and those with  immunodeficiency Due to immunity acquired in childhood most adults are not susceptible to rotavirus gastroenteritis in adults usually has a cause other than rotavirus but asymptomatic infections in adults may maintain the transmission of infection in the community There is some evidence to suggest blood group can impact on the susceptibility to infection by rotaviruses
Rotaviruses replicate mainly in the gut and infect enterocytes of the villi of the small intestine leading to structural and functional changes of the epithelium There is evidence in humans and  particularly in animal models of extraintestinal dissemination of infectious virus to other organs and macrophages
The diarrhoea is caused by multiple activities of the virus Malabsorption occurs because of the destruction of gut cells called enterocytes The toxic rotavirus protein NSP induces age and calcium iondependent chloride secretion disrupts SGLT sodiumglucose cotransporter  transportermediated reabsorption of water apparently reduces activity of brushborder membrane disaccharidases and  activates the calcium iondependent secretory reflexes of the enteric nervous system The elevated concentrations of calcium ions in the cytosol which are required for the assembly of the progeny viruses is achieved by NSP acting as a viroporin This increase in calcium ions leads to autophagy self destruction of the infected enterocytes
NSP is also secreted This extracellular form which is modified by protease enzymes in the gut is an enterotoxin which acts on uninfected cells via integrin receptors which in turn cause and increase in intracellular calcium ion concentrations secretory diarrhoea and autophagy
The vomiting which is a characteristic of rotaviral enteritis is caused by the virus infecting the enterochromaffin cells on the lining of the digestive tract The infection stimulates the production of  hydroxytryptamine serotonin This activates vagal afferent nerves which in turn activates the cells of the brain stem that control the vomiting reflex
Healthy enterocytes secrete lactase into the small intestine milk intolerance due to lactase deficiency is a symptom of rotavirus infection which can persist for weeks A recurrence of mild diarrhoea often follows the reintroduction of milk into the childs diet due to bacterial fermentation of the disaccharide lactose in the gut
Rotaviruses  elicit both B and T cell immune responses Antibodies to the rotavirus VP and VP proteins neutralise viral infectivity in vitro and in vivo Specific antibodies of the classes IgM IgA and IgG are produced which have been shown to protect against rotavirus infection by the passive transfer of the antibodies in other animals  Maternal transplacental IgG might play a role in the protection neonates from rotavirus infections  but on the other hand might reduce vaccine efficacy
Following infection by rotaviruses there is a rapid innate immune response involving types I and III interferons and other cytokines particularly Th and Th   which inhibit the replication of the virus and recruit macrophages and natural killer cells to the rotavirus infected cells The rotavirus dsRNA activates pattern recognition receptors such tolllike receptors that stimulate the production of interferons The rotavirus protein NSP counteracts the effects of type  interferons by suppressing the activity of the interferon regulatory proteins IRF IRF and IRF
The levels of IgG and IgA in the blood and IgA in the gut correlate with protection from infection  Rotavirus specific  serum IgG and IgA at high titres eg  have been claimed to be protective and there is a significant correlation between IgA titres and rotavirus vaccine efficacy
Diagnosis of infection with a rotavirus normally follows diagnosis of gastroenteritis as the cause of severe diarrhoea Most children admitted to hospital with gastroenteritis are tested for rotavirus A
Specific diagnosis of infection with rotavirus A is made by finding the virus in the childs stool by enzyme immunoassay There are several licensed test kits on the market which are sensitive specific and detect all serotypes of rotavirus A Other methods such as electron microscopy and PCR polymerase chain reaction are used in research laboratories Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction RTPCR can detect and identify all species and serotypes of human rotaviruses
Treatment of acute rotavirus infection is nonspecific and involves management of symptoms and most importantly management of dehydration If untreated children can die from the resulting severe dehydration  Depending on the severity of diarrhoea treatment consists of oral rehydration therapy during which the child is given extra water to drink that contains specific amounts of salt and sugar In  the World Health Organisation WHO and UNICEF recommended the use of lowosmolarity oral rehydration solution and zinc supplementation as a twopronged treatment of acute diarrhoea Some infections are serious enough to warrant hospitalisation where fluids are given by intravenous therapy or nasogastric intubation and the childs electrolytes and blood sugar are monitored Rotavirus infections rarely cause other complications and for a well managed child the prognosis is excellent   Probiotics have been shown to reduce the duration of rotavirus diarrhoea and according to the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology "effective interventions include administration of specific probiotics such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii diosmectite or racecadotril"
Rotaviruses are  highly contagious and cannot be treated with antibiotics or other drugs Because improved sanitation does not decrease the prevalence of rotaviral disease and the rate of hospitalisations remains high despite the use of oral rehydrating medicines the primary public health intervention is vaccination In  a rotavirus vaccine was licensed for use in the United States Clinical trials in the United States Finland and Venezuela had found it to be  to  effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by rotavirus A and researchers had detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects The manufacturer however withdrew it from the market in  after it was discovered that the vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for intussusception a type of bowel obstruction in one of every  vaccinated infants The experience provoked intense debate about the relative risks and benefits of a rotavirus vaccine
In  two new vaccines against rotavirus A infection were shown to be safe and effective in children and in   the WHO recommended that rotavirus vaccine be included in all national immunisation programmes
The incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have acted on this recommendation A  review of available clinical trial data from countries routinely using rotavirus vaccines in their national immunisation programs found that rotavirus vaccines have reduced rotavirus hospitalisations by – percent and all cause diarrhoea hospitalisations by – percent In Mexico which in  was among the first countries in the world to introduce rotavirus vaccine diarrhoeal disease death rates dropped during the  rotavirus season by more than  percent among children age two and under In Nicaragua which in  became the first developing country to introduce a rotavirus vaccine severe rotavirus infections were reduced by  percent and  emergency room visits by a half In the United States rotavirus vaccination since  has led to drops in rotavirusrelated hospitalisations by as much as  percent The vaccines may also have prevented illness in nonvaccinated children by limiting the number of circulating infections In developing countries in Africa and Asia where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur a large number of safety and efficacy trials as well as recent postintroduction impact and effectiveness studies of Rotarix and RotaTeq have found that vaccines dramatically reduced severe disease among infants In September  the vaccine was offered to all children in the UK aged between two and three months and it is expected to halve the cases of severe infection and reduce the number of children admitted to hospital because of the infection by  percent In Europe hospitalisation rates following infection by rotaviruses have decreased by  to  following the introduction of the vaccine Globally vaccination has reduced hospital admissions and emergency department visits by a median of 
Rotavirus vaccines are licensed in over  countries and more than  countries have introduced routine rotavirus vaccination almost half with the support of the GAVI vaccine alliance To make rotavirus vaccines available accessible and affordable in all countriesparticularly low and middleincome countries in Africa and Asia where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur PATH formerly Program for Appropriate Technology in Health the WHO the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and GAVI have partnered with research institutions and governments to generate and disseminate evidence lower prices and accelerate introduction
The vaccine may prevent type  diabetes
Rotavirus A which accounts for more than  of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans is endemic worldwide Each year rotaviruses cause millions of cases of diarrhoea in developing countries almost  million of which result in hospitalisation In  an estimated  children younger than five died from rotavirus infections  percent of whom were in developing countries Almost every child has been infected with rotaviruses by age five Rotaviruses are the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children is responsible for about a third of the cases requiring hospitalisation and causes  of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and  of all deaths in children younger than five Boys are twice as likely as girls to be admitted to hospital for rotavirus infections In the prevaccination era rotavirus infections occurred primarily during cool dry seasons The number attributable to food contamination is unknown
Outbreaks of rotavirus A diarrhoea are common among hospitalised infants young children attending day care centres and elderly people in nursing homes An outbreak caused by contaminated municipal water occurred in Colorado in  During  the largest recorded epidemic of diarrhoea occurred in Nicaragua This unusually large and severe outbreak was associated with mutations in the rotavirus A genome possibly helping the virus escape the prevalent immunity in the population A similar large outbreak occurred in Brazil in 
Rotavirus B also called adult diarrhoea rotavirus or ADRV has caused major epidemics of severe diarrhoea affecting thousands of people of all ages in China These epidemics occurred as a result of sewage contamination of drinking water Rotavirus B infections also occurred in India in  the causative strain was named CAL Unlike ADRV the CAL strain is endemic To date epidemics caused by rotavirus B have been confined to mainland China and surveys indicate a lack of immunity to this species in the United States Rotavirus C has been associated with rare and sporadic cases of diarrhoea in children and small outbreaks have occurred in families
The seasonal variation of rotavirus A infections in England rates of infection peak during the winter months
Preventable child deaths from rotavirus vaccination  Annual number of preventable deaths in children under five years old from rotavirus if full coverage of the rotavirus vaccine was achieved
Rotaviruses infect the young of many species of animals and they are a major cause of diarrhoea in wild and reared animals worldwide As a pathogen of livestock notably in young calves and piglets rotaviruses cause  economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality rates These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants with human strains
In  Jacob Light and Horace Hodes proved that a filterable agent in the faeces of children with infectious diarrhoea also caused scours livestock diarrhoea in cattle Three decades later preserved samples of the agent were shown to be rotavirus In the intervening years a virus in mice was shown to be related to the virus causing scours In  Ruth Bishop and colleagues described related viruses found in children with gastroenteritis
In  Thomas Henry Flewett suggested the name rotavirus after observing that when viewed through an electron microscope a rotavirus particle looks like a wheel rota in Latin the name was officially recognised by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses four years later In  related viruses were described in several other species of animals These viruses all causing acute gastroenteritis were recognised as a collective pathogen affecting humans and other animals worldwide Rotavirus serotypes were first described in  and in the following year rotaviruses from humans were first grown in cell cultures derived from monkey kidneys by adding trypsin an enzyme found in the duodenum of mammals and now known to be essential for rotavirus to replicate to the culture medium The ability to grow rotaviruses in culture accelerated the pace of research and by the mids the first candidate vaccines were being evaluated
