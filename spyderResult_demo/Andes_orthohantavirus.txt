Andes orthohantavirus ANDV a species of Orthohantavirus is a major causative agent of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome HCPS and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome HPS in South America It is named for the Andes mountains of Chile and Argentina where it was first discovered Originating in the reservoir of rodents Andes orthohantavirus is easily transmitted to humans who come into contact with infected rodents or their fecal droppings However infected rodents do not appear ill so there is no readily apparent indicator to determine whether the rodent is infected or not Additionally Andes orthohantavirus specifically is the only hantavirus that can be spread by human to human contact via bodily fluids or longterm contact from one infected individual to a healthy person
Andes orthohantavirus was first identified when outbreaks of this new infection spread throughout Chile and Argentina In  it was finally characterized in Argentina on the basis of specimens from a patient who had died from HPS complications a severe consequence of infection from Andes viruses  As an emerging virus it is more lethal than that of some of the other hantaviruses having a mortality rate between  and  in South America By far it has been responsible for the most recorded cases of HPS in Argentina Chile and Uruguay combined and contributes to a large number of kidney failure cases Although it can be carried by both humans and rodents Andes orthohantavirus is most commonly found in the Oligoryzomys longicaudatus a species of pygmy rat native to the ChileArgentina region and in other cases in the Abrothrix longipilis a longhaired grass mouse
Andes orthohantavirus is a species of Hantavirus a group of  enveloped Negativesense singlestranded RNA virus belonging to the family Hantaviridae The family consists of  genera bunyavirus phlebovirus nairovirus tospovirus and hantavirus All genera excluding hantavirus are airborne viruses while the hantavirus is rodentborne Transmission of the hantaviruses are through aerosol exposure to rodent bodily fluids Additionally Hantaviruses seem to cause no detectable cytopathology in vertebrate cell cultures
The spherical virion of the Hantavirus is typically  nm long and contains the segmented singlestranded genome The trisegmented genome includes a S small M medium and L large segment that code for nucleocapsid N glycoproteins G and G and L protein respectively The S segment of the Andes virus contains  nucleotides in total while encoding a  nucleotidelong N protein Upon comparison of S and M segments to other variants the Andes virus was found to form a lineage with viruses such as ESQ H CH H Bayou and Black Creek Canal viruses When expressed the M segment generates the glycoprotein precursor GPC which can be cleaved into the envelope Gn and Gc proteins The L protein encoded by the L segment possesses enzymatic functions that are involved within transcription and replication
In addition to these segments the virion also contains RdRP which are all enclosed in an envelope Unlike the other four genera in the family the hantavirion segments also contain a complementary terminal nucleotide sequence to the terminal sequence These nucleotide sequences are AUCAUCAUCUG at the ′ end and UAGUAGUAUGC at the ′ end
The Hantavirus replication takes place strictly in the cytoplasm of a host cell primarily targeting endothelial cells During early infection Andes virus can produce a weak innate immune response in the cell The entry and uncoating of the virus begins when the virion attaches to cell receptors on the surface of the host cell which then brings in the virus via endocytosis By a process called pHdependent fusion between the virion and the endosomal membrane nucleocapsids enter the cytoplasm The virus genome contains its own RNAdependent RNA polymerase RdRp which directs both transcription and replication of the viral genome Once the nucleocapsids are released RdRp initiates transcription by binding to the encapsidated segments While M segment mRNAs are translated by membranebound ribosomes L and S segment mRNAs are translated by free ribosomes Once transcribed the mRNA is capped by L proteins via Cap snatching These capped RNA fragments can then be transferred to L protein to be further trimmed in length by the endonuclease and used by the RdRp to initiate viral mRNA synthesis Replication is terminated when the plasma membrane begins to fuse with cytoplasmic vesicles and mature virions are released
Initial signs of an Andes orthohantavirus infection can easily be mistaken for the flu Signs and symptoms can appear as early as  days and up to  weeks after exposure The only way to diagnose Andes orthohantavirus as the cause for these symptoms is by testing the patients blood for Andes orthohantavirus genetic material or for corresponding antibodies of Andes orthohantavirus Individuals are typically only infectious while they are showing symptoms such as having one or more of the following
Although there are only two possible vectors of the virus humans and rodents there are multiple routes of infection to be aware of These include
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is an acute severe and sometimes fatal respiratory disease caused by an infection from the Andes orthohantavirus  Four to ten days after initial symptoms begin respiratory symptoms indicating HPS can appear Such symptoms include muscle aches fatigue shortness of breath and fever HPS symptoms can develop quickly therefore it is imperative to seek healthcare immediately Early care is more beneficial to the patient as there is no vaccine or specific treatment for HPS In extreme cases infected individuals may be intubated and receive oxygen therapy
Although hantavirus infections are prevalent in the United States there currently are very few recorded cases of HPS due to infection from the Andes virus in the United States and the rest of North America however there have been several cases reported in Chile and Argentina
HCPS as a result of Andes orthohantavirus infection has a case fatality rate of about – in Argentina and  in Chile ANDV lineage ANDVSout is the only hantavirus for which persontoperson transmission has been described all other human hantavirus infections are transmitted exclusively from animals to humans Several ANDV strains are cocirculating in Argentina eg Bermejo Lechiguanas Maciel Oran and Pergamino HCPS cases have also been reported in nearby Bolivia Brazil Paraguay and Uruguay but only for Chile and Argentina can they be strictly associated with ANDV
In Argentina and Chile the longtailed rice rat Oligoryzomys longicaudatus and other species of the genus Oligoryzomys have been documented as the reservoir for ANDV Another unique characteristic of ANDV is the availability of an animal model ANDV causes lethal disease in the Syrian hamster Mesocricetus auratus that closely models the course of disease progression in humans including a rapid progression from first symptoms to death which is characterized by fluid in the pleural cavity and the histopathology of the lungs and spleen Lethality of ANDV in hamsters is not true of all viruses causing HCPS hamsters infected with Sin Nombre virus for example show no symptoms of disease The availability of this model allows for the study of various drugs and other treatments that may affect the treatment of all HCPScausing hantavirus infections
When visiting geographical locations where Andes orthohantavirus has been documented such as South America people should avoid areas of high rodent populations where the virus is more likely to be found and transmitted quickly and easily from rodent to the next Properly disinfecting living spaces and areas where rodents may have been present will kill the virus before it is able to be contracted To prevent transmission from contact with infected humans individuals infected or not should handwash frequently abstain from kissing or sexual activity with one another and avoid sharing spaces of close confinement for long periods of time
There is no current treatment cure or vaccine available for illness caused by Andes virus However if patients seek medical attention quickly early symptoms can be abated through intensive care or intubation if necessary for patients with severe breathing difficulties
