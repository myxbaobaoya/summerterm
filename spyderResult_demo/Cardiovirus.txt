Cardiovirus are a group of viruses within order Picornavirales family Picornaviridae Vertebrates serve as natural hosts for these viruses
There are currently six species in the genus 
Cardiovirus A is composed of only one serotype encephalomyocarditis virus EMCV Cardiovirus B consists of four viruses that are most probably serologically distinct These are Theilers Murine encephalomyelitis virus TMEV Vilyuisk human encephalomyelitis virus VHEV a Theilerlike rat virus TRV which has yet to be named and Saffold virus SAFV Of these  only VHEV and SAFV are thought to cause infection in humans Thus far Cardiovirus C has only been observed in the brown rat
Cardioviruses are singlestranded RNA nonenveloped viruses with icosahedral or spherical geometries and a Tpseudo icosahedral capsid protein geometry The diameter is around  nm Genomes are linear and nonsegmented around  kb in length The Tpseudo icosahedral capsid of Cadiovirus is made of  protomers each of which contains  polypeptides VP VP VP and VP Inside the capsid of the virus there is a single linear positive singlestranded RNA On both the  and  ends of the genome there are untranslated regions  These untranslated regions of genome are important for the DNA replication with the untranslated region on the  side being the location of internal ribosomal entry site IRES
Viral replication is cytoplasmic Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the virus to host receptors which mediates endocytosis Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model Positive stranded rna virus transcription is the method of transcription Translation takes place by − ribosomal frameshifting viral initiation and  ribosomal skipping The virus exits the host cell by lysis and  viroporins
Human and  vertebrates serve as the natural host Transmission routes are zoonosis and fomite
The  end of the genome encodes a polyA tail while the  end encodes a genomelinked protein A unique feature of this genus is the presence of the L protein kDa that is made out of frame from the polyprotein and is present in the DA subgroup of TMEV It has been found to be important for the virus pathogenesis
In the case of Cardiovirus A the virus can cause encephalitis and myocarditis mostly in rodents which are natural hosts The virus is transmitted from rodents to other animals Severe epidemics have been seen in swine and elephants
Replication of cardioviruses is dependent on a structured RNA element called the Cardiovirus cisacting replication element CRE
Human cardioviruses were first isolated in  Seven additional isolates have since been described in North America Europe and South Asia They have been associated with gastroenteritis influenzalike symptoms and nonpolioassociated acute flaccid paralysis The first infection of cardiovirus in humans was identified in  in a stool sample of an infant that was experiencing fever of unknown origin It was subsequently named the Saffold virus after the lead researcher Morris Saffold Jones
Other pathogenic cardioviruses isolated from humans include the SyrDarya valley fever virus and Vilyuisk human encephalomyelitis virus
Diseases associated with cardioviruses include myocarditis encephalitis multiple sclerosis and type  diabetes
