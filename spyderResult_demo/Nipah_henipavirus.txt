Nipah virus scientific name Nipah henipavirus  is a batborne virus that causes Nipah virus infection in humans and other animals a disease with a high mortality rate Numerous disease outbreaks caused by Nipah virus have occurred in South and Southeast Asia Nipah virus belongs to the genus Henipavirus along with the Hendra virus which has also caused disease outbreaks
Like other henipaviruses the Nipah virus genome is a single nonsegmented negativesense singlestranded RNA of over  kb which is substantially longer than that of other paramyxoviruses The enveloped virus particles are variable in shape and can be filamentous or spherical they contain a helical nucleocapsid Six structural proteins are generated N nucleocapsid P phosphoprotein M matrix F fusion G glycoprotein and L RNA polymerase The P open reading frame also encodes three nonstructural proteins C V and W There are two envelope glycoproteins The G glycoprotein assembles as a tetramer to form the viral antireceptor or attachment protein which binds to the receptor on the host cell The F glycoprotein forms a trimer which mediates membrane fusion
Ephrins B and B have been identified as the main receptors for Nipah virus Ephrin subtypes have a complex distribution of expression throughout the body where the B is noted to have particularly high expression in some forebrain subregions
The most likely origin of this virus was in   credible interval – There are two clades of this virusone with its origin in   credible interval – and a second with its origin in   credible interval – The mutation rate was estimated to be  × − substitutionsiteyear  credible interval  × − – × − similar to other RNA viruses
Nipah virus has been isolated from Lyles flying fox Pteropus lylei in Cambodia and viral RNA found in urine and saliva from P lylei and Horsfields roundleaf bat Hipposideros larvatus in Thailand Infective virus has also been isolated from environmental samples of bat urine and partially eaten fruit in Malaysia Antibodies to henipaviruses have also been found in fruit bats in Madagascar Pteropus rufus Eidolon dupreanum and Ghana Eidolon helvum indicating a wide geographic distribution of the viruses No infection of humans or other species have been observed in Cambodia Thailand or Africa as of May 
These symptoms can be followed by more serious conditions including
The first cases of Nipah virus infection were identified in  when an outbreak of neurological and respiratory disease on pig farms in peninsular Malaysia caused  human cases with  deaths The virus itself was isolated the following year in  This outbreak resulted in the culling of one million pigs In Singapore  cases including one death occurred in abattoir workers exposed to pigs imported from the affected Malaysian farms The Nipah virus has been classified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a Category C agent The name "Nipah" refers to the place Sungai Nipah in Port Dickson Negeri Sembilan the source of the human case from which Nipah virus was first isolated Nipah virus is one of several viruses identified by WHO as a likely cause of a future epidemic in a new plan developed after the Ebola epidemic for urgent research and development before and during an epidemic toward new diagnostic tests vaccines and medicines
The outbreak was originally mistaken for Japanese encephalitis but physicians in the area noted that persons who had been vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis were not protected in the epidemic and the number of cases among adults was unusual Although these observations were recorded in the first month of the outbreak the Ministry of Health failed to take them into account and launched a nationwide campaign to educate people on the dangers of Japanese encephalitis and its vector Culex mosquitoes
Symptoms of infection from the Malaysian outbreak were primarily encephalitic in humans and respiratory in pigs Later outbreaks have caused respiratory illness in humans increasing the likelihood of humantohuman transmission and indicating the existence of more dangerous strains of the virus
Based on seroprevalence data and virus isolations the primary reservoir for Nipah virus was identified as Pteropid fruit bats including Pteropus vampyrus large flying fox and Pteropus hypomelanus small flying fox both found in Malaysia
The transmission of Nipah virus from flying foxes to pigs is thought to be due to an increasing overlap between bat habitats and piggeries in peninsular Malaysia At the index farm fruit orchards were in close proximity to the piggery allowing the spillage of urine faeces and partially eaten fruit onto the pigs Retrospective studies demonstrate that viral spillover into pigs may have been occurring undetected in Malaysia since  During  viral spread was aided by the transfer of infected pigs to other farms where new outbreaks occurred
Nipah virus infection outbreaks have been reported in Malaysia Singapore Bangladesh and India The highest mortality due to Nipah virus infection has occurred in Bangladesh where outbreaks are typically seen in winter Nipah virus first appeared in  in peninsular Malaysia in pigs and pig farmers By mid more than  human cases of encephalitis including  deaths had been reported in Malaysia and  cases of either encephalitis or respiratory illness with one fatality were reported in Singapore In  Nipah virus was reported from Meherpur District Bangladesh and Siliguri India The outbreak again appeared in   and  in Naogaon District Manikganj District Rajbari District Faridpur District and Tangail District In Bangladesh there were also outbreaks in subsequent years In September  Nipah virus resurfaced in Kerala India claiming the life of a  year old boy
