Measles virus
Measles morbillivirus MeV also called measles virus MV is a singlestranded negativesense enveloped nonsegmented RNA virus of the genus Morbillivirus within the family Paramyxoviridae  It is the cause of measles Humans are the natural hosts of the virus no animal reservoirs are known to exist
The virus causes measles a highly contagious disease transmitted by respiratory aerosols that triggers a temporary but severe immunosuppression Symptoms include fever cough runny nose inflamed eyes and a generalized maculopapular erythematous rash The virus is spread by coughing and sneezing via close personal contact or direct contact with secretions
The measles virus has two envelope glycoproteins on the viral surface – hemagglutinin H and membrane fusion protein F These proteins are responsible for host cell binding and invasion The H protein mediates receptor attachment and the F protein causes fusion of viral envelope and cellular membrane Additionally the F protein can cause infected cells to directly fuse with neighboring uninfected cells forming syncytia Three receptors for the H protein have been identified to date complement regulatory molecule CD the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule SLAMF and the cell adhesion molecule Nectin For wild type and vaccine strains extracellular domains of CD SLAM or SLAMF andor of nectin also called PoliovirusReceptorLike  PVRL mainly work as cell entry receptors Minor fraction of wild type virus strains and all modern vaccine strains derived from the Edmonston strain also use CD
Once the virus has entered a host cell its strand of negative sense ssRNA single stranded RNA is used as a template to create a positive sense copy using the RNAdependent RNA polymerase thats included in the virion Then this copy is used to create a new negative copy and so on to create many copies of the ssRNA The positive sense ssRNA is then mass translated by host ribosomes producing all viral proteins The viruses are then assembled from their proteins and negative sense ssRNA and the cell will lyse discharging the new viral particles and restarting the cycle
The RNA genome of the virus codes  main proteins Nucleoprotein N Phosphoprotein P Matrix protein M Fusion protein F Hemagglutinin H and Large Protein L which represents RNA dependent RNA polymerase RdRp The viral genome also codes two nonstructural proteins C and V These nonstructural proteins are innate immunity antagonists they help the virus to escape host immune response Inside the virion genomic RNA is forming complex with N L and P proteins N P and M proteins regulate RNA synthesis by RdRp The virus is enveloped by a lipid membrane and glycoproteins H and F are virion surface proteins that are associated with this lipid membrane
The measles virus evolved from the now eradicated but formerly widespread rinderpest virus which infected cattle Sequence analysis has suggested that the two viruses most probably diverged in the th and th centuries though the periods as early as the th century fall within the  confidence interval of these calculations
Other analysis has suggested that the divergence may be even older because of the techniques tendency to underestimate ages when strong purifying selection is in action There is some linguistic evidence for an earlier origin within the seventh century The current epidemic strain evolved at the beginning of the th centurymost probably between  and 
The measles virus genome is typically  nucleotides long and encodes eight proteins The WHO currently recognises  clades of measles A–H Subtypes are designed with numeralsA D etc Currently  subtypes are recognised The  nucleotides that code for the C‐terminal  amino acids of N are the minimum amount of sequence data required for genotyping a measles virus isolate The genotyping scheme was introduced in  and extended in  and 
Despite the variety of measles genotypes there is only one measles serotype Antibodies to measles bind to the hemagglutinin protein Thus antibodies against one genotype such as the vaccine strain protect against all other genotypes
The major genotypes differ between countries and the status of measles circulation within that country or region Endemic transmission of measles virus was interrupted in the United States and Australia by  and the Americas by 
In the early stages of infection the measles virus via CD SLAMF receptor infects immune cells located in the host respiratory tract such as macrophages and dendritic cells They transmit the virus to the lymphoid organs from which it spreads systemically In the later stages of infection the virus infects other immune cell types including B cells  and T lymphocytes  also via SLAMF receptor  In addition it infects epithelial cells located in the airways These cells become infected via  nectin receptor and by cell to cell contacts with infected immune cells The infection of epithelial cells allows the virus to be released via the airstream
