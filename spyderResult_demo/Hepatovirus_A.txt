Hepatitis A is an infectious disease of the liver caused by Hepatovirus A HAV it is a type of viral hepatitis Many cases have few or no symptoms especially in the young The time between infection and symptoms in those who develop them is – weeks When symptoms occur they typically last  weeks and may include nausea vomiting diarrhea jaundice fever and abdominal pain Around – of people experience a recurrence of symptoms during the  months after the initial infection Acute liver failure may rarely occur with this being more common in the elderly
It is usually spread by eating food or drinking water contaminated with infected feces Undercooked or raw shellfish are relatively common sources It may also be spread through close contact with an infectious person While children often do not have symptoms when infected they are still able to infect others After a single infection a person is immune for the rest of his or her life Diagnosis requires blood testing as the symptoms are similar to those of a number of other diseases It is one of five known hepatitis viruses A B C D and E
The hepatitis A vaccine is effective for preventionneeds update Some countries recommend it routinely for children and those at higher risk who have not previously been vaccinated It appears to be effective for life Other preventive measures include hand washing and properly cooking food No specific treatment is available with rest and medications for nausea or diarrhea recommended on an asneeded basis Infections usually resolve completely and without ongoing liver disease Treatment of acute liver failure if it occurs is with liver transplantation
Globally around  million symptomatic cases occur each year and about  million infections symptomatic and asymptomatic It is more common in regions of the world with poor sanitation and not enough safe water In the developing world about  of children have been infected by age  thus are immune by adulthood It often occurs in outbreaks in moderately developed countries where children are not exposed when young and vaccination is not widespread Acute hepatitis A resulted in  deaths in  World Hepatitis Day occurs each year on July  to bring awareness to viral hepatitis
Early symptoms of hepatovirus A infection can be mistaken for influenza but some sufferers especially children  exhibit no symptoms at all  Symptoms typically appear – weeks the incubation period after the initial infection About  of children do not have symptoms The time between infection and symptoms in those who develop them is – weeks with an average of  days
The risk for symptomatic infection is directly related to age with more than  of adults having symptoms compatible with acute viral hepatitis and the majority of children having either asymptomatic or unrecognized infections
Symptoms usually last less than  months although some people can be ill for as long as  months
Joint pains red cell aplasia pancreatitis and generalized lymphadenopathy are the possible extrahepatic manifestations Kidney failure and pericarditis are very uncommon If they occur they show an acute onset and disappear upon resolution of the diseasecitation needed
Hepatovirus A is a species of virus in the order Picornavirales family Picornaviridae genus Hepatovirus Humans and other vertebrates serve as natural hosts
Nine members of Hepatovirus are recognized These species infect bats rodents hedgehogs and shrews Phylogenetic analysis suggests a rodent origin for Hepatitis A
A member virus of hepatovirus B Phopivirus has been isolated from a seal This virus shared a common ancestor with Hepatovirus A about  years agocitation needed
Another hepatovirus – Marmota himalayana hepatovirus – has been isolated from the woodchuck Marmota himalayana This virus appears to have had a common ancestor with the primateinfecting species around  years agocitation needed
One serotype and seven different genetic groups four human and three simian have been described The human genotypes are numbered I–III Six subtypes have been described IA IB IIA IIB IIIA IIIB The simian genotypes have been numbered IV–VI A single isolate of genotype VII isolated from a human has also been described Genotype III has been isolated from both humans and owl monkeys Most human isolates are of genotype I Of the type I isolates subtype IA accounts for the majority
The mutation rate in the genome has been estimated to be – × − nucleotide substitutions per site per year The human strains appear to have diverged from the simian about  years ago The mean age of genotypes III and IIIA strains has been estimated to be  and  years respectively
Hepatovirus A is a picornavirus it is not enveloped and contains a positivesense singlestrand of RNA packaged in a protein shell Only one serotype of the virus has been found but multiple genotypes exist Codon use within the genome is biased and unusually distinct from its host It also has a poor internal ribosome entry site In the region that codes for the HAV capsid highly conserved clusters of rare codons restrict antigenic variability
Vertebrates such as humans serve as the natural hosts Transmission routes are fecaloral and blood
Following ingestion HAV enters the bloodstream through the epithelium  of the oropharynx or intestine  The blood carries the virus to its target the liver where it multiplies within hepatocytes and Kupffer cells liver macrophages Viral replication is cytoplasmic Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the virus to host receptors which mediates endocytosis Replication follows the positivestranded RNA virus replication model Translation takes place by viral initiation The virus exits the host cell by lysis and viroporins Virions are secreted into the bile and released in stool HAV is  excreted in large numbers about  days prior to the appearance  of symptoms or antiHAV  IgM antibodies in the blood The incubation period  is – days and risk of death in those infected is less than citation needed
Within the liver hepatocytes the RNA genome is released from the protein coat and is translated by the cells own ribosomes Unlike other picornaviruses this virus requires an intact eukaryotic initiation factor G eIFG for the initiation of translation The requirement for this factor results in an inability to shut down host protein synthesis unlike other picornaviruses The virus must then inefficiently compete for the cellular translational machinery which may explain its poor growth in cell culture Presumably for this reason the virus has strategically adopted a naturally highly deoptimized codon usage with respect to that of its cellular host Precisely how this strategy works is not quite clear yetcitation needed
No apparent virusmediated cytotoxicity occurs presumably because of the virus own requirement for an intact eIFG and liver pathology is likely immunemediated
The virus spreads by the fecal–oral route and infections often occur in conditions of poor sanitation and overcrowding Hepatitis A can be transmitted by the parenteral route but very rarely by blood and blood products Foodborne outbreaks are common and ingestion of shellfish cultivated in polluted water is associated with a high risk of infection
About  of all acute viral hepatitis is caused by HAV  Infected individuals are infectious prior to onset of symptoms roughly  days following infection  The virus is resistant to detergent acid pH  solvents eg ether chloroform drying and temperatures up to  °C  It can survive for months in fresh and salt water  Commonsource eg water restaurant outbreaks are typical  Infection is common in children in developing countries reaching  incidence but following infection lifelong immunity results  HAV can be inactivated by chlorine treatment drinking water formalin   °C  hours peracetic acid   hours betapropiolactone   hour and UV radiation  μWcmmin HAV can also be spread sexual contact specifically oroanal sexual actscitation needed
In developing countries and in regions with poor hygiene standards the rates of infection with this virus are high and the illness is usually contracted in early childhood As incomes rise and access to clean water increases the incidence of HAV decreases In developed countries though the infection is contracted primarily by susceptible young adults most of whom are infected with the virus during trips to countries with a high incidence of the disease or through contact with infectious persons
Humans are the only natural reservoir of the virus No known insect or other animal vectors can transmit the virus A chronic HAV state has not been reported
Although HAV is excreted in the feces towards the end of the incubation period specific diagnosis is made by the detection of HAVspecific IgM antibodies in the blood IgM antibody is only present in the blood following an acute hepatitis A infection It is detectable from – weeks after the initial infection and persists for up to  weeks The presence of IgG antibodies in the blood means the acute stage of the illness has passed and the person is immune to further infection IgG antibodies to HAV are also found in the blood following vaccination and tests for immunity to the virus are based on the detection of these antibodies
During the acute stage of the infection the liver enzyme alanine transferase ALT is present in the blood at levels much higher than is normal The enzyme comes from the liver cells damaged by the virus
Hepatovirus A is present in the blood viremia and feces of infected people up to  weeks before clinical illness develops
Hepatitis A can be prevented by vaccination good hygiene and sanitation
The two types of vaccines contain either inactivated Hepatovirus A or a live but attenuated virus Both provide active immunity against a future infection The vaccine protects against HAV in more than  of cases for longer than  years In the United States the vaccine developed by Maurice Hilleman and his team was licensed in  and the vaccine was first used in  for children in highrisk areas and in  it was spread to areas with elevating levels of infection
The vaccine is given by injection  An initial dose provides protection lasting one year starting – weeks after vaccination the second booster dose given six to  months later provides protection for over  years
The vaccine was introduced in  and was initially recommended for persons at high risk Since then Bahrain and Israel have embarked on elimination programmes Australia China Belarus Italy Spain and the United States have started similar programmes The incidence of hepatitis A where widespread vaccination has been practised has decreased dramatically In China and the United States the incidence of hepatitis A has decreased by  since 
In the United States vaccination of children is recommended at  and  years of age hepatitis A vaccination is not recommended in those younger than  months of age It is also recommended in those who have not been previously immunized and who have been exposed or are likely to be exposed due to travel The CDC recommends vaccination against infection for men who have sex with men
No specific treatment for hepatitis A is known Recovery from symptoms following infection may take several weeks or months Therapy is aimed at maintaining comfort and adequate nutritional balance including replacement of fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhea
In the United States in  the mortality rate for  hepatitis A was estimated to be  for the general population but ranged up to – for those aged  and over who were hospitalized with icteric hepatitis The risk of death from acute liver failure following HAV infection increases with age and when the person has underlying chronic liver diseasecitation needed
Young children who are infected with hepatitis A typically have a milder form of the disease usually lasting – weeks whereas adults tend to experience a much more severe form of the disease
Globally symptomatic HAV infections are believed to occur in around  million people a year About  million infections asymptomatic and symptomatic occurred all together in  Acute hepatitis A resulted in  deaths in  Developed countries have low circulating levels of hepatovirus A while developing countries have higher levels of circulation Most adolescents and adults in developing countries have already had the disease thus are immune Adults in midlevel countries may be at risk of disease with the potential of being exposed
Over  cases of hepatitis A were reported to the CDC in the US in  but the number has since dropped to less than  cases reported per year
The most widespread hepatitis A outbreak in the United States occurred in  in the state of Kentucky The outbreak is believed to have started in November  By July   of the states counties had reported at least one case of hepatitis A and the total number of suspected cases was  with six deaths  cases in Louisville Kentucky By July  the outbreak had reached  cases and  deaths but had slowed to just a few new cases per month
Another widespread outbreak in the United States the  US hepatitis outbreak affected at least  people killing four in northeastern Ohio and southwestern Pennsylvania in late  The outbreak was blamed on tainted green onions at a restaurant in Monaca Pennsylvania In  more than  people in Shanghai China were infected with HAV after eating clams Anadara subcrenata from a contaminated river
In June  frozen berries sold by US retailer Costco and purchased by around  people were the subject of a recall after at least  people were infected with HAV  of whom were hospitalized In April  frozen berries sold by Costco were once again the subject of a recall after at least  people in Canada were infected with HAV three of whom were hospitalized In Australia in February  a recall of frozen berries was issued after at least  people contracted the illness following their consumption of the product In  California particularly around San Diego Michigan and Utah reported outbreaks of hepatitis A that have led to over  hospitalizations and  deaths
