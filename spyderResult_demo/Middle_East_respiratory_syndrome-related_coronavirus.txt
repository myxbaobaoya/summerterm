Middle East respiratory syndromeâ€“related coronavirus MERSCoV or EMC HCoVEMC is the virus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS It is a species of coronavirus which infects humans bats and camels The infecting virus is an enveloped positivesense singlestranded RNA virus which enters its host cell by binding to the DPP receptor The species is a member of the genus Betacoronavirus and subgenus Merbecovirus
Initially called simply novel coronavirus or nCoV it was first reported in June  after genome sequencing of a virus isolated from sputum samples from a person who fell ill in a  outbreak of a new flulike respiratory illness By July  MERSCoV cases had been reported in over  countries in Europe North America and Asia as well as the Middle East MERSCoV is one of several viruses identified by the World Health Organization WHO as a likely cause of a future epidemic They list it for urgent research and development
The virus MERSCoV is a member of the beta group of coronavirus Betacoronavirus lineage C MERSCoV genomes are phylogenetically classified into two clades clade A and B The earliest cases were of clade A clusters while the majority of more recent cases are of the genetically distinct clade B
MERSCoV is one of seven known coronaviruses to infect humans including
HCoVE
HCoVNL
HCoVOC
HCoVHKU the original
SARSCoV or SARSCoV and SARSCoV It has frequently been referred to as a SARSlike virus By November   cases of MERS had been reported with  deaths implying a case fatality rate of greater than 
The first confirmed case was reported in Jeddah Saudi Arabia in April  Egyptian virologist Ali Mohamed Zaki isolated and identified a previously unknown coronavirus from the mans lungs Zaki then posted his findings on  September  on ProMEDmail The isolated cells showed cytopathic effects CPE  in the form of rounding and syncytia formation
A second case was found in September  when a yearold man living in Qatar presented with similar flu symptoms A sequence of the virus was nearly identical to that of the first case In November  similar cases appeared in Qatar and Saudi Arabia Additional cases were noted with deaths associated and rapid research and monitoring of the novel coronavirus began It is not known whether the infections are the result of a single zoonotic event with subsequent humantohuman transmission or if the multiple geographic sites of infection represent multiple zoonotic events from an unknown common sourcecitation needed
A study by Ziad Memish of Riyadh University and colleagues suggests that the virus arose some time between July  and June  with perhaps as many as seven separate zoonotic transmissionscitation needed Among animal reservoirs CoV has a large genetic diversity yet the samples from patients suggested a similar genome and therefore common source though the data were limited It was determined through molecular clock analysis that viruses from the EMC and EnglandQatar date to early  suggesting that these cases were descended from a single zoonotic event It appeared the MERSCoV had been circulating in the human population for more than a year without detection and suggested independent transmission from an unknown source
In humans the virus has a strong tropism for nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells and it has been shown to effectively evade the innate immune responses and antagonize interferon IFN production in these cells This tropism is unique in that most respiratory viruses target ciliated cells
Due to the clinical similarity between MERSCoV and SARSCoV it was proposed that they may use the same cellular receptor the exopeptidase angiotensin converting enzyme  ACE However it was later discovered that neutralization of ACE by recombinant antibodies does not prevent MERSCoV infection Further research identified dipeptidyl peptidase  DPP also known as CD as a functional cellular receptor for MERSCoV Unlike other known coronavirus receptors the enzymatic activity of DPP is not required for infection As would be expected the amino acid sequence of DPP is highly conserved across species and is expressed in the human bronchial epithelium and kidneys Bat DPP genes appear to have been subject to a high degree of adaptive evolution as a response to coronavirus infections so the lineage leading to MERSCoV may have circulated in bat populations for a long period of time before being transmitted to people
On  February  the World Health Organization stated that "the risk of sustained persontoperson transmission appears to be very low" The cells MERSCoV infects in the lungs only account for  of respiratory epithelial cells so a large number of virions are likely needed to be inhaled to cause infection
Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda Maryland stated that MERSCoV "does not spread in a sustained person to person way at all" while noting the possibility that the virus could mutate into a strain that does transmit from person to person However the infection of healthcare workers has led to concerns of human to human transmission
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC list MERS as transmissible from human to human They state that "MERSCoV has been shown to spread between people who are in close contact Transmission from infected patients to healthcare personnel has also been observed Clusters of cases in several countries are being investigated"
However on the th of May the CDC revealed that the Illinois man who was originally thought to have been the first incidence of persontoperson spread from the Indiana man at a business meeting had in fact tested negative for MERSCoV After completing additional and more definitive tests using a neutralising antibody assay experts at the CDC concluded that the Indiana patient did not spread the virus to the Illinois patient Tests concluded that the Illinois man had not been previously infected It is possible for MERS to be symptomless and early research has shown that up to  of cases show no signs of active infection but have MERSCoV antibodies in their blood
The virus appears to have originated in bats The virus itself has been isolated from a bat This virus is closely related to the Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU Serological evidence shows that these viruses have infected camels for at least  years The most recent common ancestor of several human strains has been dated to March   confidence interval December  to June 
It is thought that the viruses have been present in bats for some time and had spread to camels by the mids The viruses appear to have spread from camels to humans in the early s The original bat host species and the time of initial infection in this species has yet to be determinedcitation needed Examination of the sequences of  isolates suggested that this virus has evolved into three clades differing in codon usage host and geographic distribution
It is believed that the virus originated in bats one candidate being the Egyptian tomb bat Work by epidemiologist Ian Lipkin of Columbia University in New York showed that the virus isolated from a bat looked to be a match to the virus found in humans  c betacoronaviruses were detected in Nycteris bats in Ghana and Pipistrellus bats in Europe that are phylogenetically related to the MERSCoV virus However the major natural reservoir where humans get the virus infection remained unknown until on  August  a report in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases showed that  out of   blood serum from Omani camels and  of   from Spanish camels had proteinspecific antibodies against the MERSCoV spike protein Blood serum from European sheep goats cattle and other camelids had no such antibodies
Soon after on  September  a seroepidemiological study published in the journal of Eurosurveillance by RA Perera et al where they investigated  human and  animal sera indicated the abundant presence of MERSCoV specific antibody in  out of  Egyptian dromedary camels but not in other animals such as goats cows or sheep in this region These are the first and significant scientific reports that indicated the role of "dromedary camels" as a reservoir of MERSCoV
Research has linked camels showing that the coronavirus infection in dromedary camel calves and adults is a  match to the genomes of human clade B MERSCoV At least one person who has fallen sick with MERS was known to have come into contact with camels or recently drank camel milk Countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates produce and consume large amounts of camel meat The possibility exists that African or Australian bats harbor the virus and transmit it to camels Imported camels from these regions might have carried the virus to the Middle East
In  MERSCoV was identified in three members of a dromedary camel herd held in a Qatar barn which was linked to two confirmed human cases who have since recovered The presence of MERSCoV in the camels was confirmed by the National Institute of Public Health and Environment RIVM of the Ministry of Health and the Erasmus Medical Center WHO Collaborating Center the Netherlands None of the camels showed any sign of disease when the samples were collected The Qatar Supreme Council of Health advised in November  that people with underlying health conditions such as heart disease diabetes kidney disease respiratory disease the immunosuppressed and the elderly avoid any close animal contacts when visiting farms and markets and to practice good hygiene such as washing hands
A further study on dromedary camels from Saudi Arabia published in December  revealed the presence of MERSCoV in  of the evaluated dromedary camels  suggesting that dromedary camels not only could be the main reservoir of MERSCoV but also the animal source of MERS
According to the  March  MERSCoV summary update recent studies support that camels serve as the primary source of the MERSCoV infecting humans while bats may be the ultimate reservoir of the virus Evidence includes the frequency with which the virus has been found in camels to which human cases have been exposed seriological data which shows widespread transmission in camels and the similarity of the camel CoV to the human CoV
On  June  the Arab News newspaper highlighted the latest research findings in the New England Journal of Medicine in which a yearold Saudi man who kept a herd of nine camels died of MERS in November   His friends said they witnessed him applying a topical medicine to the nose of one of his ill camelsfour of them reportedly sick with nasal dischargeseven days before he himself became stricken with MERS  Researchers sequenced the virus found in one of the sick camels and the virus that killed the man and found that their genomes were identical  In that same article the Arab News reported that as of  June  there have been  cases of MERS reported within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with  deaths
MERSCoV is more closely related to the bat coronaviruses HKU and HKU lineage C than it is to SARSCoV lineage B   sharing more than  sequence identity with their closest relationships bat coronaviruses HKU and HKU and therefore considered to belong to the same species by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ICTVcitation needed
Strains
Saudi officials had not given permission for Dr Zaki the first isolator of the human strain to send a sample of the virus to Fouchier and were angered when Fouchier claimed the patent on the full genetic sequence of MERSCoV
The editor of The Economist observed "Concern over security must not slow urgent work Studying a deadly virus is risky Not studying it is riskier" Dr Zaki was fired from his job at the hospital as a result of bypassing the Saudi Ministry of Health in his announcement and sharing his sample and findings
At their annual meeting of the World Health Assembly in May  WHO chief Margaret Chan declared that intellectual property or patents on strains of new virus should not impede nations from protecting their citizens by limiting scientific investigations Deputy Health Minister Ziad Memish raised concerns that scientists who held the patent for MERSCoV would not allow other scientists to use patented material and were therefore delaying the development of diagnostic tests Erasmus MC responded that the patent application did not restrict public health research into MERS and MERSCoV and that the virus and diagnostic tests were shippedfree of chargeto all that requested such reagents
There are a number of mapping efforts focused on tracking MERS coronavirus On  May  the Corona Map was launched to track the MERS coronavirus in realtime on the world map The data is officially reported by WHO or the Ministry of Health of the respective country HealthMap also tracks case reports with inclusion of news and social media as data sources as part of HealthMap MERS South Korea was infected in mid with  deaths among  cases of infectioncitation needed
