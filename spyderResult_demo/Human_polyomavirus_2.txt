Human polyomavirus  commonly referred to as the JC virus or John Cunningham virus is a type of human polyomavirus formerly known as papovavirus It was identified by electron microscopy in  by ZuRhein and Chou and by Silverman and Rubinstein and later isolated in culture and named using the two initials of a patient John Cunningham with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy PML The virus causes PML and other diseases only in cases of immunodeficiency as in AIDS or during treatment with immunosuppressive drugs eg in organ transplant patients
The initial site of infection may be the tonsils or possibly the gastrointestinal tract The virus then remains latent in the gastrointestinal tract and can also infect the tubular epithelial cells in the kidneys where it continues to reproduce shedding virus particles in the urine In addition recent studies suggest that this virus may latently infect the human semen as well as the chorionic villi tissues Serum antibodies against Human polyomavirus  have also been found in spontaneous abortion affected women as well as in women who underwent voluntary interruption of pregnancy
Human polyomavirus  can cross the blood–brain barrier into the central nervous system where it infects oligodendrocytes and astrocytes possibly through the HTA serotonin receptor Human polyomavirus  DNA can be detected in both nonPML affected and PMLaffected see below brain tissue
Human polyomavirus  found in the central nervous system of PML patients almost invariably have differences in promoter sequence to Human polyomavirus  found in healthy individuals It is thought that these differences in promoter sequence contribute to the fitness of the virus in the CNS and thus to the development of PML Certain transcription factors present in the early promoter sequences of Human polyomavirus  can induce tropism and viral proliferation that leads to PML The SpiB factor was shown to be crucial in initiating viral replication in certain strains of transgenic mice The protein encoded by these early sequences Tantigen also plays a key role in viral proliferation directing the initiation of DNA replication for the virus as well as performing a transcriptional switch to allow for the formation of the various capsid and regulatory proteins needed for viral fitness Further research is needed to determine the exact etiological role of Tantigen but there seems to be a connection to the early initiation of the active virus from its archetypal dormant state
Immunodeficiency or immunosuppression allows Human polyomavirus  to reactivate In the brain it causes the often fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or PML by destroying oligodendrocytes Whether this represents the reactivation of Human polyomavirus  within the CNS or seeding of newly reactivated Human polyomavirus  via blood or lymphatics is unknown Several studies since  have suggested that the virus is also linked to colorectal cancer as Human polyomavirus  has been found in malignant colon tumors but these findings are still controversial
Although Human polyomavirus  infection is classically associated with white matter demyelination and PML pathogenesis recent literature has identified viral variants as etiological agents of other novel syndromes For example Human polyomavirus  has been found to infect the granule cell layer of the cerebellum while sparing purkinje fibers ultimately causing severe cerebellar atrophy   This syndrome called JCV granule cell layer neuronopathy JCV GCN is characterized by a productive and lytic infection by a JC variant with a mutation in the VP coding region
Human polyomavirus  also appears to mediate encephalopathy due to infection of cortical pyramidal neurons CPN and astrocytes  Analysis of the JCV CPN variant revealed differences from JCV GCN no mutations were found in the VP coding region however a –basepair deletion was identified in the agnogene coding for a –aminoacid truncated peptide which is believed to mediate CPN tropism Additionally analysis of the subcellular localization of JC CPN virions in nuclei cytoplasm and axons suggests that the virus may travel through axons to increase infectivity
Human polyomavirus  may also be a causative agent of aseptic meningitis JCVM as Human polyomavirus  was the only pathogen identified in the CSF of certain patients with meningitis  Analysis of the JCVM variant revealed archetypelike regulatory regions with no mutations in coding sequences The precise molecular mechanisms mediating Human polyomavirus  meningeal tropism remains to be found
The virus is very common in the general population infecting  to  of humans most people acquire Human polyomavirus  in childhood or adolescence It is found in high concentrations in urban sewage worldwide leading some researchers to suspect contaminated water as a typical route of infection
Minor genetic variations are found consistently in different geographic areas thus genetic analysis of Human polyomavirus  samples has been useful in tracing the history of human migration  subtypes or genotypes are recognised each associated with a specific geographical region Three are found in Europe a b and c A minor African typeAfoccurs in Central and West Africa The major African typeAfis found throughout Africa and also in West and South Asia Several Asian types are recognised Ba Bb Bd B CY MY and SC
An alternative numbering scheme numbers the genotypes – with additional lettering Types  and  are found in Europe and in indigenous populations in northern Japan NorthEast Siberia and northern Canada These two types are closely related Types  and  are found in subSaharan Africa type  was isolated in Ethiopia Tanzania and South Africa Type  is found in Ghana Both types are also found in the Biaka Pygmies and Bantus from Central Africa Type  has several variants subtype A is found mainly in the Japanese population and Native Americans excluding Inuit B is found in Eurasians D is found in Indians and E is found in Australians and western Pacific populations Subtype A is found in southern China and SouthEast Asia Subtype B is found in northern China Mongolia and Japan Subtype C is found in northern and southern China Subtype  is found in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands The geographic distribution of JC polyomavirus types may help to trace humans from different continents by JC genotyping
Since immunodeficiency causes this virus to progress to PML immunosuppressants are contraindicated in those who are infected
The boxed warning for the drug rituximab Rituxan includes a statement that Human polyomavirus  infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and death has been reported in patients treated with the drug
The boxed warning for the drug natalizumab Tysabri includes a statement that Human polyomavirus  resulted in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy developing in three patients who received natalizumab in clinical trials This is now one of the most common causes of PML
The boxed warning had been included for the drugs Tecfidera and Gilenya both of which have had incidences of PML resulting in death
The boxed warning was added on February   for the drug efalizumab Raptiva includes a statement that Human polyomavirus  resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy developed in three patients who received efalizumab in clinical trials  The drug was pulled off the US market because of the association with PML on April  
A boxed warning for brentuximab vedotin Adcetris was issued by the FDA on January   after two cases of PML were reported bringing the total number of associated cases to three
