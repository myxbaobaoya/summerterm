One of the obstacles to treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus HIV is its high genetic variability HIV can be divided into two major types HIV type  HIV and HIV type  HIV HIV is related to viruses found in chimpanzees and gorillas living in western Africa while HIV viruses are related to viruses found in the sooty mangabey a vulnerable West African primate HIV viruses may be further divided into groups The HIV group M viruses predominate and are responsible for the AIDS pandemic Group M can be further subdivided into subtypes based on genetic sequence data Some of the subtypes are known to be more virulent or are resistant to different medications Likewise HIV viruses are thought to be less virulent and transmissible than HIV M group viruses although HIV is also known to cause AIDS

HIV is the most common and pathogenic strain of the virus Over  million such infections occur annually Scientists divide HIV into a major group Group M and two or more minor groups namely Group N O and possibly a group P Each group is believed to represent an independent transmission of SIV into humans but subtypes within a group are not A total of  ORFs are found in all six possible reading frames RFs of HIV complete genome sequence but only a few of them are functional
With M for "major" this is by far the most common type of HIV with more than  of HIVAIDS cases deriving from infection with HIV group M This major HIV virus which was the source of pre pandemic viruses originated in the s in LÃ©opoldville the Belgian Congo today known as Kinshasa which is now the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo DRC Its zoonotic origin is SIVcpz which infects chimpanzees The M group is subdivided further into clades called subtypes that are also given a letter There are also "circulating recombinant forms" or CRFs derived from recombination between viruses of different subtypes which are each given a number CRFBF for example is a recombination between subtypes B and F
The spatial movement of these subtypes moved along the railways and waterways of the Democratic Republic of Congo DRC from Kinshasa to these other areas These subtypes are sometimes further split into subsubtypes such as A and A or F and Fcitation needed In  the strain CRF a recombinant of subtype A subtype D and subtype G with a subtype D protease was found to be strongly associated with rapid progression to AIDS in Cuba This is not thought to be a complete or final list and further types are likely to be found
The N stands for "nonM nonO" This group was discovered by a FrancoCameroonian team in  when they identified and isolated the HIV variant strain YBF from a Cameroonian woman who died of AIDS in  When tested the YBF variant reacted with an envelope antigen from SIVcpz rather than with those of Group M or Group O indicating it was indeed a novel strain of HIV As of  fewer than  Group N infections have been recorded
The O "Outlier" group has infected about  individuals located in WestCentral Africa and is not usually seen outside of that area It is reportedly most common in Cameroon where a  survey found that about  of HIVpositive samples were from Group O Its zoonotic origin is SIVgor which infects gorillas rather than the more common source SIVcpz The group caused some concern because it could not be detected by early versions of the HIV test kits More advanced HIV tests have now been developed to detect both Group O and Group N
In  a newly analyzed HIV sequence was reported to have greater similarity to a simian immunodeficiency virus recently discovered in wild gorillas SIVgor than to SIVs from chimpanzees SIVcpz The virus had been isolated from a Cameroonian woman residing in France who was diagnosed with HIV infection in  The scientists reporting this sequence placed it in a proposed Group P "pending the identification of further human cases"

HIV has not been widely recognized outside of Africa The first identification of HIV occurred in  in Senegal by microbiologist Souleymane Mboup and his collaborators The first case in the United States was in  The first confirmed case of HIV was a Portuguese man who was treated at the London Hospital for Tropical Diseases and later died in  He was believed to have been exposed to the disease in GuineaBissau where he lived between  and  His pathological diagnosis at the time was cryptosporidium and enterovirus infection but an analysis of his stored serum in  found that he was infected with HIV
Many test kits for HIV will also detect HIV
As of  there are eight known HIV groups A to H Of these only groups A and B are pandemic Group A is found mainly in West Africa but has also spread globally to Angola Mozambique Brazil India Europe and the US Despite the presence of HIV globally Group B is mainly confined to West Africa Despite its relative confinement HIV should be considered in all patients exhibiting symptoms of HIV that not only come from West Africa but also anyone who has had any body fluid transfer with a person from West Africa ie needle sharing sexual contact etc
HIV is closely related to simian immunodeficiency virus endemic in sooty mangabeys Cercocebus atys atys SIVsmm a monkey species inhabiting the forests of Littoral West Africa Phylogenetic analyses show that the virus most closely related to the two strains of HIV which spread considerably in humans HIV groups A and B is the SIVsmm found in the sooty mangabeys of the Tai forest in western Ivory Coast
There are six additional known HIV groups each having been found in just one person They all seem to derive from independent transmissions from sooty mangabeys to humans Groups C and D have been found in two people from Liberia groups E and F have been discovered in two people from Sierra Leone and groups G and H have been detected in two people from the Ivory Coast Each of these HIV strains for which humans are probably deadend hosts is most closely related to SIVsmm strains from sooty mangabeys living in the same country where the human infection was found
HIV diagnosis can be made when a patient has no symptoms but positive blood work indicating the individual has HIV The Multispot HIVHIV Rapid Test is currently the only FDA approved method for such differentiation between the two viruses Recommendations for the screening and diagnosis of HIV has always been to use enzyme immunoassays that detect HIV HIV group O and HIV When screening the combination if the test is positive followed by an indeterminate HIV western blot a follow up test such as amino acid testing must be performed to distinguish which infection is present According to the NIH a differential diagnosis of HIV should be considered when a person is of West African descent or has had sexual contact or shared needles with such a person West Africa is at the highest risk as it is the origin of the viruscitation needed
HIV has been found to be less pathogenic than HIV The mechanism of HIV is not clearly defined nor the difference from HIV however the transmission rate is much lower in HIV than HIV Both viruses can lead to AIDS in infected individuals and both can mutate to develop drug resistance Disease monitoring in patients with HIV includes clinical evaluation and CD cell counts while treatment includes antiretroviral therapy ART nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors NRTIs protease inhibitors PI and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors NNRTIs with the addition of CCR coreceptor antagonists and fusion inhibitors
Choice of initial andor secondline therapy for HIV has not yet been defined HIV appears to be resistant to NNRTIs intrinsically but may be sensitive to NRTIs though the mechanism is poorly understood Protease inhibitors have shown variable effect while integrase inhibitors are also being evaluated  Combination regimens of the above listed therapies are being looked into as well also showing variable effect depending on the types of therapies combined While the mechanisms are not clearly understood for HIV and HIV it is known that they use different pathways and patterns making the algorithms used to evaluate HIV resistanceassociated mutations irrelevant to HIV
Each virus can be contracted individually or they can be contracted together in what is referred to as coinfection HIV seems to have lower mortality rates less severe symptoms and slower progression to AIDS than HIV alone or the coinfection In coinfection however this is largely dependent on which virus was contracted first HIV tends to out compete HIV for disease progression Coinfection seems to be a growing problem globally as time progresses with most cases being identified in West African countries as well as some cases in the USA
If a pregnant mother is exposed screening is performed as normal If HIV is present a number of perinatal ART drugs may be given as a prophylactic to lower the risk of mothertochild transmission  After the child is born a standard sixweek regimen of these prophylactics should be initiated Breast milk may also contain particles of HIV therefore breastfeeding is strictly advised against
The rapid evolution of HIV can be attributed to its high mutation rate During the early stages of mutation evolution appears to be neutral due to the absence of an evolutionary response However when examining the virus in several different individuals convergent mutations can be found appearing in these viral populations independently
HIV evolution within a host influences factors including the virus setpoint viral load If the virus has a low setpoint viral load the host will live longer and there is a greater probability that the virus will be transmitted to another individual If the virus has a high setpoint viral load the host will live for a shorter amount of time and there is a lower probability that the virus will be transmitted to another individual HIV has evolved to maximize the number of infections to other hosts and this tendency for selection to favor intermediate strains shows that HIV undergoes stabilizing selection
The virus has also evolved to become more infectious between hosts There are three different mechanisms that allow HIV to evolve at a population level One includes the continuous battle to evolve and overcome the immune system which slows down the evolution of HIV and shifts the virus focus towards a population level Another includes the slow evolution of viral load due to viral load mutations being neutral within the host The last mechanism focuses on the virus preference to transmit founding viral strains stored during the early stages of infection This preference of the virus to transmit its stored genome copies explains why HIV evolves more quickly within the host than between hosts
HIV is evolving to a milder form but is "an awfully long way" from no longer being deadly and new severe variants are still appearing
Isolates of HIV and HIV with resistance to antiretroviral drugs arise through natural selection and genetic mutations which have been tracked and analyzed The Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database and the International AIDS Society publish lists of the most important of these first year listing  common mutations and the latest year  common mutations and made available through the Stanford HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database
