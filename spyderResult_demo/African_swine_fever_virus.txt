African swine fever virus ASFV is a large doublestranded DNA virus in the Asfarviridae family It is the causative agent of African swine fever ASF The virus causes a hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in domestic pigs some isolates can cause death of animals as quickly as a week after infection It persistently infects its natural hosts warthogs bushpigs and soft ticks of the genus Ornithodoros which likely act as a vector with no disease signs It does not cause disease in humans ASFV is endemic to subSaharan Africa and exists in the wild through a cycle of infection between ticks and wild pigs bushpigs and warthogs The disease was first described after European settlers brought pigs into areas endemic with ASFV and as such is an example of an emerging infectious disease
ASFV replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells It is the only  virus with a doublestranded DNA genome known to be transmitted by arthropods
ASFV is a large – nm icosahedral doublestranded DNA virus with a linear genome of  kilobases containing more than  genes The number of genes differs slightly among different isolates of the virus ASFV has similarities to the other large DNA viruses eg poxvirus iridovirus and mimivirus In common with other viral hemorrhagic fevers the main target cells for replication are those of monocyte macrophage lineage Entry of the virus into the host cell is receptormediated but the precise mechanism of endocytosis is presently unclear
The virus encodes enzymes required for replication and transcription of its genome including elements of a base excision repair system structural proteins and many proteins that are not essential for replication in cells but instead have roles in virus survival and transmission in its hosts Virus replication takes place in perinuclear factory areas It is a highly orchestrated process with at least four stages of transcriptionimmediateearly early intermediate and late The majority of replication and assembly occurs in discrete perinuclear regions of the cell called virus factories and finally progeny virions are transported to the plasma membrane along microtubules where they bud out or are propelled away along actin projections to infect new cells As the virus progresses through its lifecycle most if not all of the host cells organelles are modified adapted or in some cases destroyed
Assembly of the icosahedral capsid occurs on modified membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum Products from proteolytically processed polyproteins form the core shell between the internal membrane and the nucleoprotein core An additional outer membrane is gained as particles bud from the plasma membrane The virus encodes proteins that inhibit signalling pathways in infected macrophages and thus modulate transcriptional activation of immune response genes In addition the virus encodes proteins which inhibit apoptosis of infected cells to facilitate production of progeny virions Viral membrane proteins with similarity to cellular adhesion proteins modulate interaction of virusinfected cells and extracellular virions with host components
Based on sequence variation in the Cterminal region of the BL gene encoding the major capsid protein p  ASFV genotypes I–XXIII have been identified All ASFV p genotypes have been circulating in eastern and southern Africa Genotype I has been circulating in Europe South America the Caribbean and western Africa Genotype VIII is confined to four East African countries
The virus is thought to be derived from a virus of soft tick genus Ornithodoros that infects wild swine including giant forest hogs Hylochoerus meinertzhageni warthogs Phacochoerus africanus and bushpigs Potamochoerus porcus In these wild hosts infection is generally asymptomatic This virus appears to have evolved around  AD
This date is corroborated by the historical record Pigs were initially domesticated in North Africa and Eurasia They were introduced into southern Africa from Europe and the Far East by the Portuguese  years ago and Chinese  years ago respectively At the end of the th century the extensive pig industry in the native region of ASFV Kenya started after massive losses of cattle due to a rinderpest outbreak Pigs were imported on a massive scale for breeding by colonizers from Seychelles in  and from England in  Pig farming was freerange at that time The first outbreak of ASF was reported in 
ASFV has no known close relatives It is the only species in the genus Asfivirus family Asfarviridae and order Asfuvirales Each of these three taxa is at least partly named after ASFV
In the acute form of the disease caused by highly virulent strains pigs may develop a high fever but show no other noticeable symptoms for the first few days They then gradually lose their appetites and become depressed In whiteskinned pigs the extremities turn blueishpurple and hemorrhages become apparent on the ears and abdomen Groups of infected pigs lie huddled together shivering breathing abnormally and sometimes coughing If forced to stand they appear unsteady on their legs this is called congenital tremor type AI in newborn piglets Within a few days of infection they enter a comatose state and then die In pregnant sows spontaneous abortions occur
In milder infections affected pigs lose weight become thin and develop signs of pneumonia skin ulcers and swollen joints
The clinical symptoms of ASFV infection are very similar to classical swine fever and the two diseases normally have to be distinguished by laboratory diagnosis This diagnosis is usually performed by an ELISA real time PCR or isolation of the virus from either the blood lymph nodes spleen or serum of an infected pig
The virus can be spread by ticks but also by swine eating pork products that contain the virus
The National Pig Association a UK industry body states that the virus can also be transmitted by direct or indirect contact with infected pigs faeces or body fluids As the virus may survive  days in pig faeces and months or years in pork products the association advises strict biosecurity measures for pig farms including a threeday quarantine on entering the UK and avoiding both pigs and areas where wild boar are found
Vietnam successfully produced the first vaccine against African swine fever on June   An experimental vaccine is in development against the  Georgia isolate currently circulating which is attenuated by deletion of the viral IL gene
The first outbreak was retrospectively recognized as having occurred in  after ASF was first described in  in Kenya The disease remained restricted to Africa until  when it was reported in Lisbon Portugal A further outbreak occurred in Portugal in  Subsequent to these initial introductions the disease became established in the Iberian peninsula and sporadic outbreaks occurred in France Belgium and other European countries during the s Both Spain and Portugal had managed to eradicate the disease by the mids through a slaughter policy
ASFV crossed the Atlantic Ocean and outbreaks were reported in some Caribbean islands including Hispaniola Dominican Republic and Haiti Resultantly US Customs and Border Protection is on high alert to prevent any spread to the US which would inflict billions of dollars of damage to the pork industry in the country Major outbreaks of ASF in Africa are regularly reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health previously called Loffice international des épizooties
In  the virus spread to Asia affecting more than  percent of the total pig population in several countries leading to severe economic losses in the pig sector
In  an outbreak of the disease occurred in Cuba resulting in the slaughter of  pigs to prevent a nationwide animal epidemic The outbreak was labeled the "most alarming event" of  by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization
Six years after the event the newspaper Newsday citing untraceable sources claimed that antiCastro saboteurs with at least the tacit backing of US Central Intelligence Agency officials allegedly introduced African swine fever virus into Cuba six weeks before the outbreak in  to destabilize the Cuban economy and encourage domestic opposition to Fidel Castro The virus was allegedly delivered to the operatives from an army base in the Panama Canal Zone by an unnamed US intelligence source
ASFV first occurred in Europe in  when it was introduced in Portugal From there it spread to Spain and France Although concerted efforts to eradicate ASFV were undertaken such as widespread culling and the construction of modern farming facilities the disease was only eradicated in the s
In September  an outbreak occurred in wild boars in southern Belgium Professional observers suspect that importation of wild boars from Eastern European countries by game hunters was the origin of the virus By the  October  wild boars had tested positive for the virus For control of the outbreak  domestic pigs were slaughtered preventively in the Gaume region and the forest was declared offlimits for recreation
In September  the German agriculture minister confirmed on a press conference that the African swine fever virus reached Germany The virus was discovered on a wild boar carcass which the test results confirmed all as positive results The dead boar was located in the district of SpreeNeisse Brandenburg just a few kilometres from Polish EU border The dead animal had been there for quite a while according to the FriedrichLoeffler Institute which was the agency hired for testing Following these events the German government tried to lobby China and other Asian countries to separate and barring their own East German territory from exporting pork meat to these markets while West German states could keep exporting to Asia With the Chinese government and other Asian countries like South Korea ultimately refusing to these proposals
In January  an outbreak occurred in northern Italy detected on some dead wild boars in Liguria and in Piedmont
An outbreak occurred at the beginning of  in Georgia and subsequently spread to Armenia Azerbaijan Iran Russia and Belarus raising concerns that ASFV may spread further geographically and have negative economic effects on the swine industry
African swine fever had become endemic in the Russian Federation since spreading into the North Caucasus in November  most likely through movements of infected wild boar from Georgia to Chechnya said a  report by the Food and Agriculture Organization a United Nations agency The report showed how the disease had spread north from the Caucasus to other parts of the country where pig production was more concentrated the Central Federal District home to  of Russias pigs and the Volga Federal District with  of the national herd and northwest towards Ukraine Belarus Poland and the Baltic nations In Russia the report added the disease was on its way to becoming endemic in Tver oblast about  km north of Moscowand about  km east of Russias littoral neighbours on the Baltic Among the vectors for the spread in Russia of African swine fever virus was the distribution of infected pig products outside affected quarantined and trade restricted areas travelling large distances thousands of kilometers within the country
"Wholesale buyers particularly the military food supply system having been implicated multiple times in the illegal distribution of contaminated meat" were vectors for the viruss spread said the Food and Agriculture Organization reportand evidence of that was "repeated outbreaks in Leningrad oblast" The report warned that "countries immediately bordering the Russian Federation particularly Ukraine Moldova Kazakhstan and Latvia are most vulnerable to African swine fever introduction and endemic establishment largely because the biosecurity of their pig sector is predominantly low Preventing the spread of African swine fever into Ukraine is particularly critical for the whole pig production sector in Europe Given the worrisome developments in the Russian Federation European countries have to be alert They must be ready to prevent and to react effectively to African swine fever introductions into their territories for many years to come"  To stop the viruss spread "the current scenario in the Russian Federation suggests that prevention should be particularly stressed at the often informal backyard level and should involve not just pig keepers but all actors along the whole value chainbutchers middlemen slaughterhouses etc  They need to be aware of how to prevent and recognize the disease and must understand the importance of reporting outbreaks to the national authorities  It is particularly important that African swine feverfree areas remain free by preventing the reintroduction of the disease and by swiftly responding to it when it occurs"
