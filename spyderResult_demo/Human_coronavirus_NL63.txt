Human coronavirus NL HCoVNL is a species of coronavirus specifically a Setracovirus from among the Alphacoronavirus genus It was identified in late  in patients in the Netherlands The virus is an enveloped positivesense singlestranded RNA virus which enters its host cell by binding to ACE Infection with the virus has been confirmed worldwide and has an association with many common symptoms and diseases Associated diseases include mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections severe lower respiratory tract infection croup and bronchiolitis
The virus is found primarily in young children the elderly and immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory illness It also has a seasonal association in temperate climates A study performed in Amsterdam estimated the presence of HCoVNL in approximately  of common respiratory illnesses The natural reservoirs are palm civets and bats Estimates of its divergence from another coronavirus HCoVE are around  years ago it has likely circulated in humans for centuries
The evolution of HCoVNL appears to have involved recombination between an ancestral NLlike virus circulating in African Triaenops afer bats and a CoV Elike virus circulating in Hipposideros bats Recombinant viruses can arise when two viral genomes are present in the same host cell
The first cases of the infection with HCoVNL were found in young children with severe lower respiratory tract infections admitted to hospitals While the clinical presentation of the virus can be severe it has also been found in mild cases of respiratory infection The comorbidity of HCoVNL with other respiratory infections has made the specific symptoms of the virus difficult to pinpoint A study of clinical symptoms in HCoVNL patients without secondary infection reported the most common symptoms to be fever cough rhinitis sore throat hoarseness bronchitis bronchiolitis pneumonia and croup An early study investigating children with lower respiratory tract illness found that HCoVNL was more commonly found in outpatients than hospitalized patients suggesting that it is a common cold virus similar to HCoVE and HCoVOC which generally cause less severe symptoms However the high frequency of croup is specific to HCoVNL infection
It is believed that the route of HCoVNL spread is through direct persontoperson transmission in highly populated areas The virus can survive for up to a week outside of the body in aqueous solutions at room temperature and three hours on dry surfaces Most people will be infected with a coronavirus in their lifetime but some populations are more susceptible to HCoVNL These populations include children under the age of  the elderly and immunocompromised individuals The virus seems to have seasonal incidence occurring most frequently in the winter months in temperate climates  In more extreme and tropical climates the virus has no preference toward a particular season Many studies have reported the cooccurrence of HCoVNL with other human coronavirus Influenza A virus Human orthopneumovirus RSV parainfluenza virus and Human metapneumovirus hMPV
As HCoVNL infects the respiratory tract it must be inhaled to get there and is therefore transmitted by the airborne route The virus is able to survive for up to seven days in respiratory secretions and remains infectious at room temperature Once the virus has entered the host it binds to cellular receptors via its spike proteins The virus is able to use Angiotensinconverting enzyme  ACE as an entry receptor to bind to and enter target cells
It is difficult to distinguish between symptoms caused by infection of the HCoVNL virus and those caused by other common human viruses making diagnosis and detection complex Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of samples collected through nasopharyngeal swab is the most commonly used method for detection of the virus Viral culture or blood serum testing for antibodies may also be used for the confirmation of infection
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC recommends several measures for the prevention of infection with HCoVNL including washing hands often with soap and water avoiding close contact with sick individuals and not touching the eyes mouth or nose
Treatment for the HCoVNL virus is dependent on the severity of associated symptomology Most mild to moderate infections will go away on their own Symptoms can be relieved by taking a pain reliever or fever medication taking a hot shower or using a humidifier Antiviral treatment may be necessary for infected patients that end up in the intensive care unit ICU due to acute respiratory infection Intravenous immunoglobulin is an FDA approved HCoVNL inhibitor that is also used to treat primary immune deficiency RSV and Kawasaki disease
HCoVNL is one of seven known coronaviruses to infect humans The other six are
Research published in  by Esper et al suggested an association of HCoVNL infection with Kawasaki disease a systemic vasculitis in childhood that may result in aneurysms of the coronary arteries In the developed world Kawasaki disease is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children Further analysis of HCoVNL pathogenicity seems warranted in particular because of recent evidence that this virus uses the same cellular receptor ACE as both SARSCoV the causal agent of SARS and SARSCoV the causal agent of COVID the latter of which provokes an eerily similar immune response HCoVNL has also been found in the intestinal tract of infected individuals and linked to gastroenteritis This type of infection is the direct result of the viral invasion of the mucosal lining of the intestines  The role of HCoVNL in gastroenteritis is unclear due to typical coinfection with other viruses in this condition HCoVNL is likely underdetected due its role in many mild to moderate respiratory infections and comorbidity with other disease Researchers have suggested that more comprehensive populationbased studies are necessary to determine the effects of this virus on systems outside of the respiratory tract
