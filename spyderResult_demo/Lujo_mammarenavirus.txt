Lujo is a bisegmented RNA virusa member of the family Arenaviridaeand a known cause of viral hemorrhagic fever VHF in humans Its name was suggested by the Special Pathogens Unit of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases of the National Health Laboratory Service NICDNHLS by using the first two letters of the names of the cities involved in the  outbreak of the disease Lusaka Zambia and Johannesburg Republic of South Africa It is the second pathogenic Arenavirus to be described from the African continentthe first being Lassa virusand since  has been classed as a "Select Agent" under US law
Only  cases of this virus have ever been reported all  were identified in September and October  and  were fatal Those infections that proved fatal caused death within – days of showing symptoms All four patients in which infection proved fatal first showed signs of improvement and then went into respiratory distress displayed neurological problems and had circulatory issues that resulted in collapse The discovery of this novel virus was described following a highly fatal nosocomial hospital outbreak of VHF in Johannesburg The identification of this virus was the first new arenavirus discovered in over  years
The first case was a female travel agent who lived in the outskirts of Lusaka She suffered from fever which grew worse with time She was evacuated to Johannesburg for medical treatment Almost two weeks later the paramedic that nursed the patient on the flight to South Africa also fell ill and was also brought to Johannesburg for medical treatment At this time the connection between these two patients was recognized by the attending physician in the Johannesburg hospital Together with the NICDNHLS the clinical syndrome of VHF was recognized and specimens from the second patient were submitted for laboratory confirmation In addition a cleaner and a nurse that had contact with the first patient also fell ill A second nurse was infected through contact with the paramedic The outbreak had a high case fatality rate with  of  identified cases resulting in death
The Special Pathogens Unit of the NICDNHLS together with colleagues from the Special Pathogens Unit of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC identified the etiological agent of the outbreak as an Old World arenavirus using molecular and serological tests Sequencing and phylogenetic investigation of partial genome sequencing indicated that this virus was not Lassavirus and likely a previously unreported arenavirus This was corroborated by full genome sequencing that was conducted by the NICDNHLS CDC and collaborators from Columbia University in New York
The distribution of this newly described arenavirus is uncertain To date this virus has only been reported from a patient from Zambia and a subsequent nosocomial outbreak in South Africacitation needed
Viruses from the Arenaviridae family to which Lujo virus belongs almost always have a rodent reservoir with one virus in the family having a bat reservoir Contact with an infected rodent host its urine or fecal matter inhalation of dust with virus particles or eating food containing remnants of the virus can result in human infection Transmission can also occur via humantohuman contact as evidenced by the  cases from  but it is still not completely clear how the first case was contracted Both bats and rodents should be considered possible contact points just to be safe Though it is not known for sure it is speculated that the humantohuman transmission occurs from contact with bodily fluids The incubation period is expected to be – days
VHF symptoms appear similar to other viruses of the same family such as Lassa fever The known symptoms include swelling in the neck and face sore throat diarrhea and a rash resembling measles on the face and body Blood tests of those infected revealed elevated liver values white blood cell counts that were first low and then elevated over time and low platelet counts
Indepth research into Lujo virus and its treatment have been difficult because of the lack of economic and cultural stability of the regions where the only known cases have occurred Treatment with ribavirin seemed to have cured the only surviving patient with Lujo Virus but because the  affected in  have been the only cases identified there has not been much opportunity for further research
Sequencing of the viral genome has shown that this virus belongs to the Old World arenavirus group Comparisons with other viral genome sequences showed that this virus is equidistant from other Old World and New World arenaviruses It is distantly similar to the other pathogenic African arenavirus Lassa fever virus
This virus has been associated with an outbreak of five cases of VHF in September and October  In four cases  of total known infections the infection was fatal The fifth case was treated with ribavirin early after onset of clinical disease was detected through active contact tracing an antiviral drug which is effective in treating Lassa fever and survived however ribavirins effectiveness against Lujo virus remains unknown
