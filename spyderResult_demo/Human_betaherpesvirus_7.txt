Human betaherpesvirus  HHV is one of nine known members of the Herpesviridae family that infects humans HHV is a member of Betaherpesvirinae a subfamily of the Herpesviridae that also includes HHV and Cytomegalovirus HHV or HCMV HHV often acts together with HHV and the viruses together are sometimes referred to by their genus Roseolovirus HHV was first isolated in  from CD T cells taken from peripheral blood lymphocytes
Both HHVB and HHV as well as other viruses can cause a skin condition in infants known as exanthema subitum although HHV causes the disease less frequently than HHVB HHV infection also leads to or is associated with a number of other symptoms including acute febrile respiratory disease fever rash vomiting diarrhea low lymphocyte counts and febrile seizures though most often no symptoms present at all
There are indications that HHV can contribute to the development of druginduced hypersensitivity syndrome encephalopathy hemiconvulsionhemiplegiaepilepsy syndrome hepatitis infection postinfectious myeloradiculoneuropathy pityriasis rosea and the reactivation of HHV leading to "mononucleosislike illness"
Complications with HHV infection has been shown to be a factor in a great variety of transplant types
A mature virus particle measures about  nanometres  Å in diameter
The genome of HHV is very similar to that of HHV although it is about  smaller with a DNA genome of about  base pairs There are a number of key differences between the genome of HHV and that of HHV but the importance of them for viral DNA replication is not yet known
HHV resides mostly in CD T cells albeit only in certain strains of them To enter CD T cells HHV unlike HHV uses CD and possibly some cellsurface glyoproteins to enter CD T cells About a week after HHV has infected a cell it begins to downregulate CD transcription which interferes with HIV infection but may reactivate HHV infection It is however unclear exactly what effect HHV has on HIV infection
HHV also has a number of other effects on cells Among these include membrane leaking the presence of lytic syncytia occasional apoptosis the supporting of latent infection and increases and decreases in levels of certain cytokines
In adults the effects of HHV separate from HHV have not been wellresearched One reason for this is because the detection of HHV was at first difficult to do quickly as the process for doing so involves a procedure that is difficult to do in commercial laboratories and because viral isolation and serological testing are long processes that do not lend themselves to finishing quickly A process known as loopmediated isothermal amplification LAMP has recently been developed to speed up detection of HHV although a larger sample size of patients must be tested first to see if the test will still work across a broad range of subjects No reliable serological test has been developed yet for HHV alone but multiple are in the process of being developed The use of PCR assays to test for HHV is also being explored
No treatment for HHV infection exists but no clinical situation where such treatment would be useful has yet been discovered
Over  of adults have been infected and are immune to HHV and over three quarters of those were infected before the age of six Primary infection of HHV among children generally occurs between the ages of  and  which means it occurs after primary infection of HHV A  Washington University School of Medicines analysis of  healthy adults sampled at as many as five major body habitats found that HHV was present in  of them especially in the mouth A  study looking at the human blood virome in  humans between the ages of  months to  years found that  of them were positive for HHV
