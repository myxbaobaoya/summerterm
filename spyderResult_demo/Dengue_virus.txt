Dengue virus DENV is the cause of dengue fever It is a mosquitoborne single positivestranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae genus Flavivirus  Four serotypes of the virus have been found a reported fifth has yet to be confirmed all of which can cause the full spectrum of disease Nevertheless scientists understanding of dengue virus may be simplistic as rather than distinct antigenic groups a continuum appears to exist  This same study identified  strains of dengue virus  Additionally coinfection with and lack of rapid tests for zika virus and chikungunya complicate matters in realworld infections
Dengue virus has increased dramatically within the last  years becoming one of the worst mosquitoborne human pathogens which tropical countries have to deal with Current estimates indicate that as many as  million infections occur each year and many dengue infections are increasingly understood to be asymptomatic or subclinical
Based on the analysis of the envelope protein  at least three genotypes  to  are known In  a fourth serotype was reported A single report of a fifth serotype DEN in  has not been replicated or further reported on The rate of nucleotide substitution for this virus has been estimated to be ×− per nucleotide per year a rate similar to other RNA viruses The American African genotype has been estimated to have evolved between  and  This period includes World War I and World War II which were associated with considerable movement of populations and environmental disturbance factors known to promote the evolution of new vectorborne viral species
A Bayesian analysis of all four serotypes estimated that their most recent common ancestor existed about  AD  confidence interval  BC AD
Until a few hundred years ago dengue virus was transmitted in sylvatic cycles in Africa Southeast Asia and South Asia between mosquitoes of the genus Aedes and nonhuman primates with rare emergences into human populations The global spread of dengue virus however has followed its emergence from sylvatic cycles and the primary lifecycle now exclusively involves transmission between humans and Aedes mosquitoes Vertical transmission from mosquito to mosquito has also been observed in some vector species Dogs have been found to be infected by the virus but more research is needed to determine if dogs or other animals can serve as reservoirs or are just incidental hosts
Recent findings suggest that as the virus infects human cells host homeostatic processes such as autophagy and ER stress response not to mention apoptosis are triggered depending on the infected cell type The activation of autophagy and ER stress during infection enhances virus reproduction
 Attempts to provide detailed summaries of the life cycle of dengue at the cellular level are published in review articles from different research groups

The DENV genome is about  bases of positivesense single stranded RNA ssRNA that codes for three structural proteins capsid protein C membrane protein M envelope protein E and seven nonstructural proteins NS NSa NSb NS NSa NSb NS It also includes short noncoding regions on both the  and  ends
The DENV E envelope protein found as a dimer on the surface of the mature viral particle is important in the initial attachment of this particle to the host cell Each E protein monomer comprises three ectodomains ED to ED and a transmembrane segment ED includes the dimerization interface two glycosylation sites and the peptide of fusion with the cellular membrane ED is a continuous polypeptide segment its fold is compact and immunoglobulinlike Dengue virus is transmitted by species of the mosquito genus Aedes Several molecules that interact with the viral E protein ICAMgrabbing nonintegrin CD Rab  GRP  and the mannose receptor have been shown to be important factors mediating attachment and viral entry The membrane form of ribosomal protein SA may also be involved in the attachment E protein is known to contain physicochemically conserved B cells and T cells specific epitopes which can be exploited to design vaccine   Recombinant domains of the E protein are used as welldefined antigens in the serological detection of antibodies directed against dengue virus and as immunogens in vaccine candidates
The DENV prM membrane protein which is important in the formation and maturation of the viral particle consists of seven antiparallel βstrands stabilized by three disulfide bonds
The glycoprotein shell of the mature DENV virion consists of  copies each of the E and M proteins The immature virion starts out with the E and prM proteins forming  heterodimers that give a spiky exterior to the viral particle This immature viral particle buds into the endoplasmic reticulum and eventually travels via the secretory pathway to the Golgi apparatus As the virion passes through the transGolgi network  it is exposed to low pH This acidic environment causes a conformational change in the E protein which disassociates it from the prM protein and causes it to form E homodimers which lie flat against the viral surface giving the maturing virion a smooth appearance During this maturation pr peptide is cleaved from the M peptide by the host protease furin The M protein then acts as a transmembrane protein under the Eprotein shell of the mature virion The pr peptide stays associated with the E protein until the viral particle is released into the extracellular environment This pr peptide acts like a cap covering the hydrophobic fusion loop of the E protein until the viral particle has exited the cell
The DENV NS is a serine protease as well as an RNA helicase and RTPaseNTPase The protease domain consists of six βstrands arranged into two βbarrels formed by residues – of the protein The catalytic triad His Asp and Ser is found between these two βbarrels and activity is dependent on the presence of a  amino acid segment of the NSB cofactor This cofactor wraps around the NS protease domain and becomes part of the active site The remaining NSB residues before and after the cofactor region contain helical domains involved in membrane binding The remaining NS residues – form the three subdomains of the DENV helicase A sixstranded parallel βsheet surrounded by four αhelices makes up subdomains I and II and subdomain III is composed of four αhelices surrounded by three shorter αhelices and two antiparallel βstrands
DENV NSA is a nonstructural protein involved in altering cell membrane curvature and induction of autophagy In addition to its membrane altering property NSA is a scaffold for the virus replication complex and undergoes oligomerization Mutations of NSA that affect interaction with NSB abolished or severely reduced virus replication indicating the importance of NSA and its interaction with NSB in dengue reproduction Also NSA from four of the five serotypes of dengue all induce autophagy and protect infected cells from toxins via the ATM pathway suggesting a conserved function for the protein among dengue viruses
The DENV NS protein is a residue peptide with a methyltransferase domain at its Nterminal end residues – and a RNAdependent RNA polymerase RdRp at its Cterminal end residues – The methyltransferase domain consists of an αββ sandwich flanked by Nand Cterminal subdomains The DENV RdRp is similar to other RdRps containing palm finger and thumb subdomains and a GDD motif for incorporating nucleotides
Crystal structures of complexes between antibodies and either the ectodomain sE of the viral E protein or its domain  ED have helped understand the molecular bases of the virus recognition and neutralization Some of the epitopes are partially or totally inaccessible in the known structure of the mature virion The corresponding antibodies are therefore assumed to bind to alternate or transitional conformations of the virus at  °Ccitation needed
Common names for dengue fever include breakbone fever vomiting and dandy fever dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome are the severe forms Dengue is found in tropical and subtropical climates worldwide mostly in urban and semiurban areas People of all ages who are exposed to infected mosquitoes are possible victims of dengue fever The disease occurs most often during the rainy season in tropical countries in Southeast Asia South Asia and South America with high numbers of infected mosquitoes The virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes though humans are not capable of transmitting the disease and are not contagious The incubation period is  to  days while the period of the illness is – days Signs and symptoms may include severe headache retroorbital pain muscle joint and bone pain macular or maculopapular rash and minor hemorrhagic manifestations including petechiae ecchymosis purpura epistaxis bleeding gums hematuria or a positive tourniquet test result A recent systematic review and metaanalysis showed that allergic symptoms are one of the core symptoms that are highly associated with dengue severity
Some people suffer from more severe forms of dengue such as dengue hemorrhagic fever Different strains of viruses interacting with people with different immune backgrounds lead to a complex interaction Among the possible causes are crossserotypic immune response through a mechanism known as antibodydependent enhancement which happens when a person who has been previously infected with dengue gets infected for the second third or fourth time The previous antibodies to the old strain of dengue virus now interfere with the immune response to the current strain leading paradoxically to more virus entry and uptake
In recent years many studies have shown that flaviviruses especially dengue virus has the ability to inhibit the innate immune response during the infection
Indeed dengue virus has many nonstructural proteins that allow the inhibition of various mediators of the innate immune system response These proteins act on two levels 
NSB is a small hydrophobic protein located in association with the endoplasmic reticulum It may block the phosphorylation of STAT  after induction by interferons type I alpha  beta In fact as the activity of Tyk kinase decreases in association with dengue virus so too does STAT  phosphorylation Furthermore the innate immune systems response to the virus is further damped as expression of interferonstimulating genes ISG is restricted by the aforementioned NSB protein NSA and NSA cofactor may also take part in the STAT  inhibition
NS  the presence of this kDa protein results in inactivation of STAT via the signal transduction of the response to interferon when it is expressed alone When NS is cleaved with NSB by a protease NSB it can degrade STAT In fact after the cleavage of NS by the protease  an E ligase association with STAT occurs and the E ligase targets STAT for the degradation
NSBb protease complex is a proteolytic core consisting of the last  amino acids of NSB and the first  amino acids of NS
Cleavage of the NSB precursor activates the protease complex
This protease complex allows the inhibition of the production of type I interferon by reducing the activity of IFNbeta promoter NSB protease complex is involved in inhibiting the phosphorylation of IRF
The NSB protease complex inhibits by cleaving protein MITA which allows the IRF activation
Dengue virus is transmitted by the mosquito species Aedes aegypti which produces saliva that contains over  unique proteins including the protein family D Scientists used to believe that A aegypti saliva when being transmitted actually enhanced dengue virus in the body The mosquitos saliva was thought to make the virus spread faster due to the weakened immune response of its host However a current study has found that the protein D hinders the virus transmission into the host cells
The immune responses of antibodies that are trying to fight off the foreign virus actually increase transmission and make the infection worse Levels of protein D are more prevalent in salivary glands of dengueinfected mosquitoes compared to those uninfected ones D is found in mosquito saliva and was thought to assist the process of blood feeding Despite the prior assumptions D can modulate the host cell and act against the virus to prevent viral infection Unfortunately D proteins provoke immune responses which raise antiD antibody levels These antibodies inhibit the function of D proteins which enhance transmission of dengue viruscitation needed Although immune responses against D proteins might impair their antiviral activity a study showed that nonDENV subjects have slightly higher antiD IgG levels than infected ones although it was not statistically significant Thus more studies over D protein family are needed do elucidate its role on DENV infection and its applicability in medicine
Only one vaccine for dengue is currently approved in  countries Mexico the Philippines Indonesia Brazil El Salvador Costa Rica Paraguay Guatemala Peru Thailand and Singapore Several vaccines are under development by private and public researchers Developing a vaccine against the disease is challenging With four different serotypes of the virus that can cause the disease the vaccine must immunize against all four types to be effective Vaccination against only one serotype could possibly lead to severe dengue hemorrhagic shock when infected with another serotype due to antibodydependent enhancement When infected with dengue virus the immune system produces crossreactive antibodies that provide immunity to that particular serotype  However these antibodies are incapable of neutralizing other serotypes upon reinfection and actually increase viral replication When macrophages consume the neutralized virus the virus is able to replicate within the macrophage causing disease These crossreactive ineffective antibodies ease access of virus into macrophages which induces more severe disease dengue hemorrhagic fever dengue shock syndrome A common problem faced in dengueendemic regions is when mothers become infected with dengue after giving birth offspring carry the immunity from their mother and are susceptible to hemorrhagic fever if infected with any of the other three serotypes One vaccine was in phase III trials in  and planning for vaccine usage and effectiveness surveillance had started
In  SanofiPasteur started building a new facility in NeuvillesurSaône fr a suburb of Lyon France This unit produces fourserotype vaccine for phase III trials In September  the SanofiPasteur CEO gave early results of the phase III trial efficacy study in Latin America The efficacy per serotype ST varied widely  for ST  for ST  for ST and  for ST The full analysis of data from the phase III Latin AmericanCaribbean study will be reviewed by external experts before being published in a peerreviewed scientific journal Primary results has to be presented at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene Annual Meeting held November –  in New Orleans
In September   one of the vaccines was reported to not have done well in clinical trials
In late  and early  the first dengue vaccine Dengvaxia CYDTDV by SanofiPasteur was registered in several countries for use in individuals – years of age living in endemic areas
On May   the US Food and Drug Administration announced the approval of Dengvaxia the first vaccine for the prevention of dengue disease caused by all dengue virus serotypes in people ages  through  who have laboratoryconfirmed previous dengue infection and who live in endemic areas Dengue is endemic in the US territories of American Samoa Guam Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands
There are no approved direct antiviral treatments for Dengue fever Most antiviral drug research for Dengue infections has focussed on inhibition of the NSBNS protease or NS proteins Reported protease inhibitor approaches have focussed mainly on targeted covalent inhibitors  One drug Balapiravir a repurposed hepatitis C NS polymerase inhibitor progressed to a Phase II clinical trial before being stopped due to lack of efficacy
