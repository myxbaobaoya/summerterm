The genus Marburgvirus is the taxonomic home of Marburg marburgvirus whose members are the two known marburgviruses Marburg virus MARV and Ravn virus RAVV  Both viruses cause Marburg virus disease in humans and nonhuman primates a form of viral hemorrhagic fever  Both are Select agents  World Health Organization Risk Group  Pathogens requiring Biosafety Level equivalent containment National Institutes of HealthNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Category A Priority Pathogens  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Category A Bioterrorism Agents and are listed as Biological Agents for Export Control by the Australia Group
The genus Marburgvirus is a virological taxon included in the family Filoviridae order Mononegavirales The genus currently includes a single virus species Marburg marburgvirus The members of the genus ie the actual physical entities are called marburgviruses The name Marburgvirus is derived from the city of Marburg in  Hesse West Germany where Marburg virus was first discovered and the taxonomic suffix virus which denotes a virus genus Even though the virus was named after the city of Marburg Dr Ana Gligic lead virologist at a laboratory in Belgrade was first who managed to isolate the virus
Until  the family Filoviridae contained only one genus Filovirus  Once it became clear that marburgviruses and ebolaviruses are fundamentally different this genus was abolished and a genus "Marburglike viruses" was established for marburgviruses In  the genus name was changed to Marburgvirus and in  and  the genus was emended
A virus that fulfills the criteria for being a member of the family Filoviridae is a member of the genus Marburgvirus if
The species was introduced in  as Marburg virus
Because of easy confusion with its virus member Marburg virus the species name was changed to Lake Viktoria marburgvirus in 
In  it was proposed to change the name to Marburg marburgvirus and this proposal was accepted in early  by the ICTV
Marburg marburgvirus also referred to as Lake Victoria marburgvirus is a virological taxon ie a manmade concept included in the genus Marburgvirus family Filoviridae order Mononegavirales The species has two virus members Marburg virus MARV and Ravn virus RAVV The members of the species ie the actual physical entities are called Marburg marburgviruses The name Marburg marburgvirus is derived from the city of Marburg in  Hesse West Germany where Marburg virus was first discovered and the taxonomic suffix marburgvirus which denotes a marburgvirus species
A virus that fulfills the criteria for being a member of the genus Marburgvirus is a member of the species Marburg marburgvirus if it has the properties of marburgviruses because there is currently only marburgvirus species and if its genome differs from that of Marburg virus variant Musoke by  at the nucleotide level
