The hepatitis E virus HEV is the causative agent of hepatitis E It is of the species Orthohepevirus Aa
Globally approximately  million corresponding to  in  individuals have ever experienced HEV infection About â€“ million individuals have recent or ongoing HEV infection
The virus particle was first seen in  but was only molecularly cloned in 
Orthohepevirus A can be classified into eight different genotypes from different geographical regions genotype  Asia genotype  Africa and Mexico genotype  Europe and North America genotype  Asia genotypes  and  have been detected in Asian wild boar and genotypes  and  in camels
The viral genome is a single strand of positivesense RNA that is about  bases in length The three openreading frames ORF ORF and ORF encode for three proteins O O O two of which are polyproteins that is they are cleaved into fragments which carry out the actual functions of the virus see figure The O protein consists of seven such fragments namely Met methyltransferase Y Ydomain Plp papainlike protease V prolinerich variable region X Xdomain macrodomain Hel helicase and Rdrp RNAdependent RNA polymerase The Pvx domain is a fusion protein consisting of the  Plp V and X domains The O protein is encoded by a single openreading frame ORF The O protein encodes the capsid which is composed of three domains namely the shell domain S and two protruding domains P P Numbers in the figure indicate positions in the RNA sequence

The proteinprotein interactome among Orthohepevirus A proteins has been mapped by Osterman et al  who found  interactions among the  proteins studied Almost all  of these interactions were considered as of "high quality"
The viral particles are  to  nanometers in diameter and are not enveloped
It was previously classified in the family Caliciviridae However its genome more closely resembles rubella virus It is now classified as a member of the genus Orthohepevirus in the family Hepeviridae
The strains of HEV that exist today may have arisen from a shared ancestor virus  to  years ago Another analysis has dated the origin of Hepatitis E to  years ago with a suggestion that this was associated with domestication of pigs At some point two clades may have diverged  an anthropotropic form and an enzootic form  which subsequently evolved into genotypes  and  and genotypes  and  respectively
Whereas genotype  remains less commonly detected than other genotypes genetic evolutionary analyses suggest that genotypes   and  have spread substantially during the past  years
