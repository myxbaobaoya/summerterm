Machupo virus
Bolivian hemorrhagic fever BHF also known as black typhus or Ordog Fever is a hemorrhagic fever and zoonotic infectious disease originating in Bolivia after infection by Machupo mammarenavirus
BHF was first identified in  as an ambisense RNA virus of the Arenaviridae family by a research group led by Karl Johnson The mortality rate is estimated at  to  percent Due to its pathogenicity Machupo virus requires Biosafety Level Four conditions the highest level
During the period between February and March  some  suspected BHF cases  fatal were reported to the Servicio Departamental de Salud SEDES in Beni Department Bolivia In February  at least  suspected new cases  fatal were reported to SEDES In November  a second case was confirmed near the departmental capital of Trinidad and a serosurvey was conducted to determine the extent of Machupo virus infections in the Department A SEDES expert involved in the survey expressed his concerns about the expansion of the virus to other provinces outside the endemic regions of Mamoré and Iténez provinces
The disease was first encountered in  in the Bolivian village of San Joaquín hence the name "Bolivian" Hemorrhagic Fever When initial investigations failed to find an arthropod carrier other sources were sought before finally determining that the disease was carried by infected mice Although mosquitoes were not the cause as originally suspected the extermination of mosquitoes using DDT to prevent malaria proved to be indirectly responsible for the outbreak in that the accumulation of DDT in various animals along the food chain led to a shortage of cats in the village subsequently a mouse plague erupted in the village leading to an epidemic
The vector is the  large vesper mouse Calomys callosus a rodent indigenous to northern Bolivia Infected animals are asymptomatic and shed the virus in excreta thereby infecting humans Evidence of persontoperson transmission of BHF exists but is believed to be rare
The infection has a slow onset with fever malaise headache and myalgia very similar to Malaria symptoms Petechiae blood spots on the upper body and bleeding from the nose and gums are observed when the disease progresses to the hemorrhagic phase usually within seven days of onset  Severe hemorrhagic or neurologic symptoms are observed in about one third of patients Neurologic symptoms involve tremors delirium and convulsions The mortality rate is about 
Measures to reduce contact between the vesper mouse and humans may have contributed to limiting the number of outbreaks with no cases identified between  and  Although there are no cures or vaccine for the disease a vaccine developed for the genetically related Junín virus which causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever has shown evidence of crossreactivity to Machupo virus and may therefore be an effective prophylactic measure for people at high risk of infection Post infection and providing that the person survives the infection those that have contracted BHF are usually immune to further infection of the disease
Bolivian hemorrhagic fever was one of three hemorrhagic fevers and one of more than a dozen agents that the United States researched as potential biological weapons before the nation suspended its biological weapons program in  Albert Nickel a year old animal caretaker at Fort Detrick died in  from the disease after being bitten by an infected mouse Nickel Place on Fort Detrick is named in his honor It was also under research by the Soviet Union under the Biopreparat bureau
Investigational vaccines exist for Argentine hemorrhagic fever and RVF however neither is approved by FDA or commonly available in the United States
The structure of the attachment glycoprotein has been determined by Xray crystallography and this glycoprotein is likely to be an essential component of any successful vaccine
