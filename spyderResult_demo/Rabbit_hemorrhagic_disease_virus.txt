Rabbit hemorrhagic disease RHD also known as viral hemorrhagic disease VHD is a highly infectious and lethal form of viral hepatitis that affects European rabbits Some viral strains also affect hares and cottontail rabbits Mortality rates generally range from  to  percent The disease is caused by strains of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus RHDV a lagovirus in the family Caliciviridae
Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus RHDV is a virus in the genus Lagovirus and the family Caliciviridae It is a nonenveloped virus with a diameter around – nm icosahedral symmetry and a linear positivesense RNA genome of – kb RHDV causes a generalized infection in rabbits that is characterized by liver necrosis disseminated intravascular coagulation and rapid death Division into serotypes has been defined by a lack of crossneutralization using specific antisera Rabbit lagoviruses also include related caliciviruses such as European brown hare syndrome virus
RHDV appears to have evolved from a preexisting avirulent rabbit calicivirus RCV Nonpathogenic rabbit caliciviruses related to but distinct from RHDV had been circulating apparently harmlessly in Europe Australia and New Zealand prior to the emergence of RHDV In the course of its evolution RHDV split into six distinct genotypes all of which are highly pathogenic
The three strains of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus of medical significance are RHDV RHDVa and RHDV RHDV also referred to as RHDV RHDV or as classical RHD only affects adult European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus This virus was first reported in China in  from which it spread to much of Asia Europe Australia and elsewhere A few isolated outbreaks of RHDV have occurred in the United States and Mexico but they remained localized and were eradicatedcitation needed
In  a new lagovirus with a distinct antigenic profile was identified in France The new virus named rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus  abbreviated as RHDV or RHDVb also caused RHD but exhibited distinctive genetic antigenic and pathogenic features Importantly RHDV killed rabbits previously vaccinated with RHDV vaccines and affected young European rabbits as well as hares Lepus spp All these features strongly suggest that the virus was not derived from RHDVa but from some other unknown source RHDV has since spread to the majority of Europe as well as to Australia Canada and the United Statescitation needed
Both viruses causing RHD are extremely contagious Transmission occurs by direct contact with infected animals carcasses bodily fluids urine feces respiratory secretions and hair Surviving rabbits may be contagious for up to  months Contaminated fomites such as clothing food cages bedding feeders and water also spread the virus Flies fleas and mosquitoes can carry the virus between rabbits Predators and scavengers can also spread the virus by shedding it in their feces Caliciviruses are highly resistant in the environment and can survive freezing for prolonged periods The virus can persist in infected meat for months and for prolonged periods in decomposing carcasses Importation of rabbit meat may be a major contributor in the spread of the virus to new geographic regions
RHD outbreaks tend to be seasonal in wild rabbit populations where most adults have survived infection and are immune As young kits grow up and stop nursing they no longer receive the antibodies provided in their mothers milk and become susceptible to infection Thus RHD epizootics occur more often during the rabbits breeding season
Generally high host specificity exists among lagoviruses Classic RHDVa only affects European rabbits a species native to Europe and from which the domestic rabbit is descended The new variant RHDV affects European rabbits as well but also causes fatal RHD in various Lepus species including Sardinian Cape hares L capensis mediterraneus Italian hares L corsicanus and mountain hares L timidus Reports of RHD in Sylvilagus species have been coming from the current outbreak in the United States
RHD caused by RHDV and RHDVa demonstrates high morbidity up to  and mortality  in adult European rabbits Young rabbits – weeks old are less likely to be infected and kits younger than  weeks old do not become ill The more recently emerged RHDV causes death and disease in rabbits as young as  days old Mortality rates from RHDV are more variable at  Initially less virulent the pathogenicity of RHDV has been increasing and is now similar to that found with RHDV and RHDVa Deaths from RHDV have been confirmed in rabbits previously vaccinated against RHDVa
These viruses replicate in the liver and by mechanisms not fully elucidated trigger the mass death of hepatocytes which can in turn lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation hepatic encephalopathy and nephrosis Bleeding may occur as clotting factors and platelets are used up
The incubation period for RHDVa is – days and for RHDV – days Rabbits infected with RHDV are more likely to show subacute or chronic signs than are those infected with RHDVa In rabbitries an epidemic with high mortality rates in adult and subadult rabbits is typical If the outbreak is caused by RHDV then deaths also occur in young rabbitscitation needed
RHD can vary in the rate clinical signs occur In peracute cases rabbits are usually found dead with no premonitory symptoms Rabbits may be observed grazing normally immediately before death
In acute cases rabbits are inactive and reluctant to move They may develop a fever up to  °C  °F and have increased heart and respiratory rates Bloody discharge from the nose mouth or vulva is common as is blood in the feces or urine Lateral recumbency coma and convulsions may be observed before death Rabbits with the acute form generally die within  to  hours from the onset of fever
Subacute to chronic RHD has a more protracted clinical course and is more commonly noted with RHDV infections Clinical signs include lethargy anorexia weight loss and jaundice Gastrointestinal dilation cardiac arrhythmias heart murmurs and neurologic abnormalities can also occur Death if it occurs usually happens – weeks after the onset of symptoms and is due to liver failure
Not all rabbits exposed to RHDVa or RHDV become overtly ill A small proportion of infected rabbits clears the virus without developing signs of disease Asymptomatic carriers also occur and can continue to shed virus for months thereby infecting other animals Surviving rabbits develop a strong immunity to the specific viral variant with which they were infected
A presumptive diagnosis of RHD can often be made based on clinical presentation infection pattern within a population and post mortem lesions Definitive diagnosis requires detection of the virus As most caliciviruses cannot be grown in cell culture antibody and nucleic acid based methods of viral detection are often used
Complete blood counts from rabbits with RHD often show low levels of white blood cells and platelets and chemistry panels show elevated liver enzymes Evidence of liver failure may also be present including increased bile acids and bilirubin and decreased glucose and cholesterol Prolonged prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times are typical Urinalysis can show bilirubinuria proteinuria and high urinary GGT
The classic post mortem lesion seen in rabbits with RHD is extensive hepatic necrosis Multifocal hemorrhages splenomegaly bronchopneumonia pulmonary hemorrhage or edema and myocardial necrosis may sometimes also be seen
RTqPCR tests are a commonly used and accurate testing modality for RNAbased viruses Other tests used include enzymelinked immunosorbent assay electron microscopy immunostaining Western blot and in situ hybridization The tissue of choice for molecular testing is fresh or frozen liver as it usually contains the largest numbers of virus but if this is not available spleen and serum can also be used Identification of the strain of RHDV is needed so vaccination protocols can be adjusted accordinglycitation needed
A number of vaccines available against RHD are sold in countries where the disease is endemic All provide  months of protection against RHD viruses Because RHD viruses cannot normally be grown in vitro how these vaccines are produced is affected Inactivated RHD vaccines including Eravac Felavac and Cylap are liverderived meaning that laboratory rabbits are intentionally infected with RHD and their livers and spleens harvested to make vaccines Each rabbit used results in the production of thousands of vaccine doses This has led to controversy among rabbit lovers who question the ethics of some rabbits having to die to protect others but is not an issue where rabbits are primarily farmed for meat Another method of reproducing the virus is through recombinant technology where antigenic portions of the RHD viruses are inserted into viruses that can be grown in culture This is the method used to create Nobivac MyxoRHD PLUS
Vaccines against only the classic RHDVa strain are Cylap RCD Vaccine made by Zoetis protects rabbits from two different strains of RHDVa v and K that are used for wild rabbit control in Australia CUNIPRAVAC RHD® manufactured by HIPRA protects against the RHDVa strains found in Europe Nobivac MyxoRHD made by MSD Animal Health is a live myxomavectored vaccine that offers oneyear duration of immunity against both RHDVa and myxomatosiscitation needed
Vaccines against only the newer RHDV strain are Eravac vaccine manufactured by HIPRA protects rabbits against RHDV for a year
Vaccines that protect against both RHDVa and RHDV strains include Filavac VHD K CV manufactured by Filavie protects against both classical RHDVa and RHDV It is available in single dose and multidose vials A soontobereleased vaccine from MSD Animal Health Nobivac MyxoRHD PLUS is a live recombinant vector vaccine active against both RHDVa and RHDV as well as myxomatosis
Countries in which RHD is not considered endemic may place restrictions on importation of RHDV vaccines Importation of these vaccines into the United States can only be done with the approval of the United States Department of Agriculture and the appropriate state veterinarian
Caliciviruses are stable in the environment and difficult to inactivate Products commonly used for household disinfection such as Clorox® and Lysol® disinfecting wipes do not work against these viruses One effective option is to wipe down surfaces with a  bleach solution allowing  minutes of contact time before rinsing Other disinfectants shown to work include  sodium hydroxide  OneStroke Environ® Virkon® S Clorox® Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes Trifectant® Rescue® and hydrogen peroxide cleaners Surface debris must always be mechanically removed prior to disinfection A list of disinfectants that are effective against calicivirus in this case norovirus can be found on the Environmental Protection Agencys website Studies have show that many quaternary ammonium compound based disinfectants do not inactivate caliciviruses
Because of the highly infectious nature of the disease strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur Depopulation disinfection vaccination surveillance and quarantine are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner Surviving rabbits should be quarantined or humanely euthanized Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms
RHD is primarily a disease affecting European rabbits which are native to the Iberian Peninsula and are found in the wild in much of Western Europe Domesticated breeds are farmed throughout the world for meat and fur and are becoming increasingly popular pets European rabbits have been introduced to and become feral and sometimes invasive in Australia New Zealand Chile Argentina and various islands
RHD was first reported in  in the Peoples Republic of China Since then RHD has spread to over  countries in Africa the Americas Asia Europe and Oceania and is endemic in most parts of the world
The first reported outbreak of RHD caused by RHDVa occurred in  in the Jiangsu Province of the China The outbreak occurred in a group of Angora rabbits that had been imported from Germany The cause of the disease was determined to be a small nonenveloped RNA virus An inactivated vaccine was developed that proved effective in preventing disease In less than a year the disease spread over an area of  km in China and killed  million domestic rabbits
South Korea was the next country to report RHD outbreaks following the importation of rabbit fur from China RHD has since spread to and become endemic in many countries in Asia including India and the Middle Eastcitation needed
From China RHDVa spread westward to Europe The first report of RHD in Europe came from in Italy in  From there it spread to much of Europe Spains first reported case was in  and France Belgium and Scandinavia followed in  Spain experienced a large dieoff of wild rabbits which in turn caused a population decline in predators that normally ate rabbits including the Iberian lynx and Spanish imperial eagle
RHD caused by RHDVa was reported for the first time in the United Kingdom in  This initial epidemic was brought under control in the late s using a combination of vaccination strict biosecurity and good husbandry The newer viral strain RHDV was first detected in England and Wales in  and soon spread to Scotland and Ireland
In  a new virus variant called rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus  RHDV emerged in France RHDV has since spread from France to the rest of Europe Great Britain Australia and New Zealand Outbreaks started occurring in the United States and Vancouver Island Canada in 
RHD was detected for the first time in Finland in  The outbreak occurred in feral European rabbits and genetic testing identified the viral strain as RHDV Cases of viral transmission to domesticated pet rabbits have been confirmed and vaccinating rabbits has been recommended
In  a strain of the RHDVa virus Czech CAPM RHDV was imported to Australia under strict quarantine conditions to research the safety and usefulness of the virus if it were used as a biological control agent against Australia and New Zealands rabbit pest problem Testing of the virus was undertaken on Wardang Island in Spencer Gulf off the coast of the Yorke Peninsula South Australia In  the virus escaped quarantine and subsequently killed  million rabbits within  weeks of its release In March  a new Korean strain known as RHDV K was successfully released in a deliberate manner after almost a decade of research This strain was chosen in part because it functions better in cool wet regions where the previous Calicivirus was less effective
In July  after considering over  public submissions the New Zealand Ministry of Health decided not to allow RHDVa to be imported into New Zealand to control rabbit populations However in late August RHDVa was confirmed to have been deliberately and illegally introduced to the Cromwell area of the South Island An unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease It was however being intentionally spread and several farmers notably in the Mackenzie Basin area admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading Had the disease been introduced at a better time control of the population would have been more effective but it was released after breeding had commenced for the season and rabbits under  weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease These young rabbits were therefore able to survive and breed rabbit numbers back up Ten years on rabbit populations in the Mackenzie Basin in particular are beginning to reach near preplague proportions once again though they have not yet returned to preRHD levels Resistance to RHD in New Zealand rabbits has led to the widespread use of Compound  Sodium fluoroacetate The government and department of conservation are having to increase their use of  to protect reserve land from rabbits and preserve the gains made in recent years through the use of RHD
Isolated outbreaks of RHDVa in domestic rabbits have occurred in the United States the first of which was in Iowa in  In  outbreaks occurred in Utah Illinois and New York More recent outbreaks of RHDVa have occurred in  in Indiana and  in Pennsylvania Each of these outbreaks was contained and was the result of separate but indeterminable introductions of RHDVa RHDVa does not affect the native cottontail and jackrabbits in the United States so the virus did not become endemic
The first report of RHDV virus in North America was on a farm in Québec in  In  a larger outbreak occurred in feral European rabbits on Delta and Vancouver Island British Columbia The disease was confirmed later that year in a pet rabbit in Ohio In July  the first case of RHDV in Washington was confirmed in a pet rabbit from Orcas Island RHDV have been reported in domestic rabbits in Washington and New Yorkcitation needed
In  outbreaks of the disease in domestic rabbits as well as cottontail rabbits and hares have been reported in Arizona New Mexico Colorado Texas Nevada California and Utah Affected wildlife include mountain cottontail rabbits Sylvilagus nutalli desert cottontail rabbits S audubonii antelope jackrabbits L alleni and blacktailed jackrabbits L californicus The virus circulating in the Southwest United States is distinct from the RHDV isolated from New York Washington Ohio and British Columbia Canada The sources of these outbreaks are unknown
Mexico experienced an outbreak of RHDVa in domestic rabbits from  to  presumably following the importation of rabbit meat from the Peoples Republic of China Strict quarantine and depopulation measures were able to eradicate the virus and the country was officially declared to be RHDfree in  A second outbreak of RHD in domestic rabbits began in the state of Chihuahua in April  and has since spread to Sonora Baja California Baja California Sur Coahuila and Durango
Since  RHDVa has been endemic in Cuba Four epizootics involving domesticated rabbits were reported in   – and – As consequence thousands of rabbits have died or have been slaughtered each time The virus is also believed to be thriving in Bolivia
