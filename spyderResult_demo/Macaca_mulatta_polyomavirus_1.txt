SV is an abbreviation for simian vacuolating virus  or simian virus  a polyomavirus that is found in both monkeys and humans Like other polyomaviruses SV is a DNA virus that has the potential to cause tumors in animals but most often persists as a latent infection SV has been widely studied as a model eukaryotic virus leading to many early discoveries in eukaryotic DNA replication and transcription
The hypothesis that SV might cause cancer in humans has been a particularly controversial area of research It is currently unclear whether SV has any role in causing tumors As a result of these uncertainties academic opinion remains divided with some arguing that this hypothesis is not supported by the data and others arguing that some cancers may involve SV The US National Cancer Institute announced in  that although SV does cause cancer in some animal models "substantial epidemiological evidence has accumulated to indicate that SV likely does not cause cancer in humans" This announcement was based on two studies This  announcement is in contrast to a  study performed by The National Academy of Sciences Immunization Safety Review committee that stated "The committee concludes that the biological evidence is moderate that SV exposure could lead to cancer in humans under natural conditions"
SV may act as a cocarcinogen with crocidolite asbestos to cause mesothelioma The mechanism may involve suppression of the transcriptional properties of tumor suppressor p in humans by the SV large T antigen and SV small Tantigen Tumor suppressor p is responsible for initiating regulated cell death "apoptosis" or cell cycle arrest when a cell is damaged A mutated p gene may contribute to uncontrolled cellular proliferation leading to a tumor
Some vaccines made in the USA between  and  were found to be contaminated with SV from the growth medium and from the original seed strain Population level studies did not show extensive evidence of increase in cancer incidence as a result of exposure though SV has been extensively studied A thirtyfive year followup did not find excess numbers of cancers associated with SV
SV consists of an unenveloped icosahedral virion with a closed circular doublestranded DNA genome of  kb The virion adheres to cell surface receptors of MHC class I by the virion glycoprotein VP Penetration into the cell is through a caveolin vesicle Inside the cell nucleus the cellular RNA polymerase II acts to promote early gene expression This results in an mRNA that is spliced into two segments The small and large T antigens result from this The large T antigen has two functions  goes to the plasma cell membrane and  returns to the nucleus Once in the nucleus the large T antigen binds three viral DNA sites I II and III Binding of sites I and II autoregulates early RNA synthesis Binding to site II takes place in each cell cycle Binding site I initiates DNA replication at the origin of replication Early transcription gives two spliced RNAs that are both s Late transcription gives both a longer s which synthesizes the major viral capsid protein VP and the smaller s which gives VP and VP through leaky scanning All of the proteins besides the  of large T return to the nucleus because assembly of the viral particle happens there A putative late protein VP is has been reported to act as a viroporin facilitiating release of viral particles and resulting in cytolysis however the presence and role of VP have been disputed
SV is capable of multiplicity reactivation MR MR is the process by which two or more virus genomes containing otherwise lethal damage interact within an infected cell to form a viable virus genome Yamamato and Shimojo observed MR when SV virions were irradiated with UV light and allowed to undergo multiple infection of host cells Hall studied MR when SV  virions were exposed to the DNA crosslinking agent   trimethylpsoralen Under conditions in which only a single virus particle entered each host cell approximately one DNA crosslink was lethal to the virus and could not be repaired In contrast when multiple viral genomes infected a host cell psoraleninduced DNA crosslinks were repaired that is MR occurred  Hall suggested that the virions with crosslinked DNA were repaired by recombinational repair Michod et al reviewed numerous examples of MR in different viruses and suggested that MR is a common form of sexual interaction that provides the advantage of recombinational repair of genome damages
The early promoter for SV contains three elements The TATA box is located approximately  basepairs upstream from the transcriptional start site The  basepair repeats contain six GC boxes and are the site that determines the direction of transcription Also the  basepair repeats are transcriptional enhancers When the SP protein interacts with the  basepair repeats it binds either the first or the last three GC boxes Binding the first three initiates early expression binding the last three initiates late expression The function of the  basepair repeats is to enhance the amount of stable RNA and increase the rate of synthesis This is done by binding dimerization with the AP transcription factor to give a primary transcript that is  polyadenylated and  cappedcitation needed
SV is dormant and is asymptomatic in rhesus monkeys The virus has been found in many macaque populations in the wild where it rarely causes disease However in monkeys that are immunodeficientdue to for example infection with simian immunodeficiency virusSV acts much like the human JC and BK polyomaviruses producing kidney disease and sometimes a demyelinating disease similar to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy In other species particularly hamsters SV causes a variety of tumors generally sarcomas In rats the oncogenic SV large T antigen was used to establish a brain tumor model for primitive neuroectodermal tumor and medulloblastoma
The molecular mechanisms by which the virus reproduces and alters cell function were previously unknown and research into SV vastly increased biologists understanding of gene expression and the regulation of cell growthcitation needed
SV was first identified by Ben Sweet and Maurice Hilleman in  when they found that between  and  of polio vaccines in the USA were contaminated with SV In  Bernice Eddy described the SV oncogenic function inducing sarcoma and ependymomas in hamsters inoculated with monkeys cells infected with SV The complete viral genome was sequenced by Weissman at Yale University USA in  and also by Fiers and his team at the University of Ghent Belgium
