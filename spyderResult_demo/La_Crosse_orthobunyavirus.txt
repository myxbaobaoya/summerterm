La Crosse encephalitis is an encephalitis caused by an arbovirus the La Crosse virus which has a mosquito vector Ochlerotatus triseriatus synonym     Aedes triseriatus
La Crosse encephalitis virus LACV is one of a group of mosquitotransmitted viruses that can cause encephalitis or inflammation of the brain LAC encephalitis is rare in the United States about â€“ LACV disease cases are reported each year although it is believed to be underreported due to minimal symptoms experienced by many of those affected
It takes  to  days after the bite of an infected mosquito to develop symptoms of LACV disease Symptoms include nausea headache vomiting in milder cases and seizures coma paralysis and permanent brain damage in severe cases
LAC encephalitis initially presents as a nonspecific summertime illness with fever headache nausea vomiting and lethargy Severe disease occurs most commonly in children under the age of  and is characterized by seizures coma paralysis and a variety of neurological sequelae after recovery Death from LAC encephalitis occurs in less than  of clinical cases In many clinical settings pediatric cases presenting with CNS involvement are routinely screened for herpes or enteroviral causes Since there is no specific treatment for LAC encephalitis physicians often do not request the tests required to specifically identify LAC virus and the cases are reported as aseptic meningitis or viral encephalitis of unknown cause
As with many infections the very young the very old and the immunocompromised are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms
The La Crosse encephalitis virus is a type of arbovirus called a bunyavirus The Bunyavirales are mainly arboviruses
Most cases of LAC encephalitis occur in children under  years of age LAC virus is a zoonotic pathogen cycled between the daytimebiting treehole mosquito Aedes triseriatus and vertebrate amplifier hosts chipmunks tree squirrels in deciduous forest habitats The virus is maintained over the winter by transovarial transmission in mosquito eggs If the female mosquito is infected she may lay eggs that carry the virus and the adults coming from those eggs may be able to transmit the virus to chipmunks and to humanscitation needed
Anyone bitten by a mosquito in an area where the virus is circulating can get infected with LACV The risk is highest for people who live work or recreate in woodland habitats because of greater exposure to potentially infected mosquitoescitation needed
People reduce the chance of getting infected with LACV by preventing mosquito bites There is no vaccine or preventive drug
Prevention measures against LACV include reducing exposure to mosquito bites Use repellent such as DEET and picaridin while spending time outside especially at during the daytime  from dawn until dusk Aedes triseriatus mosquitoes that transmit LACV are most active during the day Wear long sleeves pants and socks while outdoors Ensure all screens are in good condition to prevent mosquitoes from entering your home Aedes triseriatus prefer treeholes to lay eggs in Also remove stagnant water such as old tires birdbaths flower pots and barrels
No specific therapy is available at present for La Crosse encephalitis and management is limited to alleviating the symptoms and balancing fluids and electrolyte levels Intravenous ribavirin is effective against La Crosse encephalitis virus in the laboratory and several studies in patients with severe brain biopsy confirmed La Crosse encephalitis are ongoing
In a trial with  children being infected with La Crosse viral encephalitis were treated at certain phases with ribavirin RBV RBV appeared to be safe at moderate doses At escalated doses of RBV adverse events occurred and then the trial was discontinued Nonetheless this was the largest study of antiviral treatment for La Crosse encephalitis
La Crosse encephalitis was discovered in  after the virus was isolated from stored brain and spinal tissue of a child who died of an unknown infection in La Crosse Wisconsin in  It occurs in the Appalachian and Midwestern regions of the United States  Recently there has been an increase of cases in the South East of the United States  An explanation to this may be that the mosquito Aedes albopictus is also an efficient vector of La Crosse virus  Aedes albopictus is a species that has entered the US and spread across the SE of the US and replaced Aedes aegypti in most areas which is not an efficient vector of LAC
Historically most cases of LAC encephalitis occur in the upper Midwestern states Minnesota Wisconsin Iowa Illinois Indiana and Ohio Recently more cases are being reported from states in the midAtlantic West Virginia Virginia and North Carolina and southeastern Alabama and Mississippi regions of the country It has long been suspected that LAC encephalitis has a broader distribution and a higher incidence in the eastern United States but is underreported because the causal agent is often not specifically identified
LAC encephalitis cases occur primarily from late spring through early fall but in subtropical areas where the mosquito is found eg the Gulf states rare cases can occur in winter
According to the CDC between  and  there were  total cases of La Crosse encephalitis and  deaths in the US
Looking at the distribution of cases across the United States by state between  and  the most cases of La Crosse encephalitis was in North Carolina North Carolina had  total cases followed by Ohio with  total cases
Similar diseases that are spread by mosquitoes include Western and Eastern equine encephalitis Japanese encephalitis Saint Louis encephalitis and West Nile virus
