Sindbis virus SINV is a member of the Togaviridae family in the Alphavirus genus The virus was first isolated in  in Cairo Egypt The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes Culex and Culiseta SINV is linked to Pogosta disease Finland Ockelbo disease Sweden and Karelian fever Russia In humans the symptoms include arthralgia rash and malaise Sindbis virus is widely and continuously found in insects and vertebrates in Eurasia Africa and Oceania Clinical infection and disease in humans however has almost only been reported from Northern Europe Finland Sweden Russian Karelia where SINV is endemic and where large outbreaks occur intermittently Cases are occasionally reported in Australia China and South Africa
SINV is an arbovirus it is arthropodborne and it is maintained in nature by transmission between vertebrate bird hosts and invertebrate mosquito vectors Humans are infected with Sindbis virus when bitten by an infected mosquito
Sindbis viruses are enveloped particles with an icosahedral capsid with a positive single stranded RNA genome with an approximate size of  kb The RNA has a cap and polyadenylated tail and therefore serves directly as messenger RNA mRNA in a host cell The genome encodes four nonstructural proteins the capsid and two envelope proteins This is characteristic of all Togaviruses Replication is cytoplasmic and rapid The genomic RNA is partially translated at the  end to produce the nonstructural proteins which are then involved in genome replication and the production of new genomic RNA and a shorter subgenomic RNA strand This subgenomic strand is translated into the structural proteins The viruses assemble at the host cell surfaces and acquire their envelope through budding
A noncoding RNA element has been found to be essential for Sindbis virus genome replication
Recombination has been demonstrated between RNAs of Sindbis virus  The mechanism of recombination appears to be template switching copy choice during RNA replication
