Zika virus ZIKV pronounced ˈziːkə or ˈzɪkə is a member of the virus family Flaviviridae It is spread by daytimeactive Aedes mosquitoes such as A aegypti and A albopictus Its name comes from the Ziika Forest of Uganda where the virus was first isolated in  Zika virus shares a genus with the dengue yellow fever Japanese encephalitis and West Nile viruses Since the s it has been known to occur within a narrow equatorial belt from Africa to Asia From  to update the virus spread eastward across the Pacific Ocean to the Americas leading to the – Zika virus epidemic
The infection known as Zika fever or Zika virus disease often causes no or only mild symptoms similar to a very mild form of dengue fever While there is no specific treatment paracetamol acetaminophen and rest may help with the symptoms As of April  no vaccines have been approved for clinical use however a number of vaccines are currently in  clinical trials Zika can spread from a pregnant woman to her baby This can result in microcephaly severe brain malformations and other birth defects Zika infections in adults may result rarely in Guillain–Barré syndrome
In January  the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC issued travel guidance on affected countries including the use of enhanced precautions and guidelines for pregnant women including considering postponing travel Other governments or health agencies also issued similar travel warnings while Colombia the Dominican Republic Puerto Rico Ecuador El Salvador and Jamaica advised women to postpone getting pregnant until more is known about the risks
Zika virus belongs to the family Flaviviridae and the genus Flavivirus thus is related to the dengue yellow fever Japanese encephalitis and West Nile viruses Like other flaviviruses Zika virus is enveloped and icosahedral and has a nonsegmented singlestranded  kilobase positivesense RNA genome It is most closely related to the Spondweni virus and is one of the two known viruses in the Spondweni virus clade
A positivesense RNA genome can be directly translated into viral proteins As in other flaviviruses such as the similarly sized West Nile virus the RNA genome encodes seven nonstructural proteins and three structural proteins in the form of a single polyprotein QZE One of the structural proteins encapsulates the virus This protein is the flavivirus envelope glycoprotein that binds to the endosomal membrane of the host cell to initiate endocytosis The RNA genome forms a nucleocapsid along with copies of the kDa capsid protein The nucleocapsid in turn is enveloped within a hostderived membrane modified with two viral glycoproteins Viral genome replication depends on the making of doublestranded RNA from the singlestranded positivesense RNA ssRNA genome followed by transcription and replication to provide viral mRNAs and new ssRNA genomes
A longitudinal study shows that  hours after cells are infected with Zika virus the vacuoles and mitochondria in the cells begin to swell This swelling becomes so severe it results in cell death also known as paraptosis This form of programmed cell death requires gene expression IFITM is a transmembrane protein in a cell that is able to protect it from viral infection by blocking virus attachment Cells are most susceptible to Zika infection when levels of IFITM are low Once the cell has been infected the virus restructures the endoplasmic reticulum forming the large vacuoles resulting in cell death
There are two Zika lineages the African lineage and the Asian lineage Phylogenetic studies indicate that the virus spreading in the Americas is  identical to African genotypes but is most closely related to the Asian strain that circulated in French Polynesia during the – outbreak
The Asian strain appears to have first evolved around 
The vertebrate hosts of the virus were primarily monkeys in a socalled enzootic mosquitomonkeymosquito cycle with only occasional transmission to humans Before the current pandemic began in  Zika "rarely caused recognized spillover infections in humans even in highly enzootic areas" Infrequently however other arboviruses have become established as a human disease and spread in a mosquito–human–mosquito cycle like the yellow fever virus and the dengue fever virus both flaviviruses and the chikungunya virus a togavirus Though the reason for the pandemic is unknown dengue a related arbovirus that infects the same species of mosquito vectors is known in particular to be intensified by urbanization and globalization Zika is primarily spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and can also be transmitted through sexual contact or blood transfusions The basic reproduction number R a measure of transmissibility of Zika virus has been estimated to be between  and  
In  news reports drew attention to the rapid spread of Zika in Latin America and the Caribbean At that time the Pan American Health Organization published a list of countries and territories that experienced "local Zika virus transmission" comprising Barbados Bolivia Brazil Colombia the Dominican Republic Ecuador El Salvador French Guiana Guadeloupe Guatemala Guyana Haiti Honduras Martinique Mexico Panama Paraguay Puerto Rico Saint Martin Suriname and Venezuela By August  more than  countries had experienced active local transmission of Zika virus
Zika is primarily spread by the female Aedes aegypti mosquito which is active mostly in the daytime The mosquitos must feed on blood to lay eggs   The virus has also been isolated from a number of arboreal mosquito species in the genus Aedes such as A africanus A apicoargenteus A furcifer A hensilli A luteocephalus and A vittatus with an extrinsic incubation period in mosquitoes around  days
The true extent of the vectors is still unknown Zika has been detected in many more species of Aedes along with Anopheles coustani Mansonia uniformis and Culex perfuscus although this alone does not incriminate them as vectors To detect the presence of the virus usually requires genetic material to be analysed in a lab using the technique RTPCR A much cheaper and faster method involves shining a light at the head and thorax of the mosquito and detecting chemical compounds characteristic of the virus using nearinfrared spectroscopy
Transmission by A albopictus the tiger mosquito was reported from a  urban outbreak in Gabon where it had newly invaded the country and become the primary vector for the concomitant chikungunya and dengue virus outbreaks New outbreaks can occur if a person carrying the virus travels to another region where A albopictus is common
The potential societal risk of Zika can be delimited by the distribution of the mosquito species that transmit it The global distribution of the most cited carrier of Zika A aegypti is expanding due to global trade and travel A aegypti distribution is now the most extensive ever recorded – on parts of all continents except Antarctica including North America and even the European periphery Madeira the Netherlands and the northeastern Black Sea coast A mosquito population capable of carrying Zika has been found in a Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington DC and genetic evidence suggests they survived at least four consecutive winters in the region The study authors conclude that mosquitos are adapting for persistence in a northern climate Zika virus appears to be contagious via mosquitoes for around a week after infection The virus is thought to be infectious for a longer period of time after infection at least  weeks when transmitted via semen
Research into its ecological niche suggests that Zika may be influenced to a greater degree by changes in precipitation and temperature than dengue making it more likely to be confined to tropical areas However rising global temperatures would allow for the disease vector to expand their range further north allowing Zika to follow
Zika can be transmitted from men and women to their sexual partners most known cases involve transmission from symptomatic men to women As of April  sexual transmission of Zika has been documented in six countries – Argentina Australia France Italy New Zealand and the United States – during the  outbreak ZIKV can persist in semen for several months with viral RNA detected up to one year The virus replicates in the human testis where it infects several cell types including testicular macrophages peritubular cells and germ cells the spermatozoa precursors Semen parameters can be altered in patients for several weeks postsymptoms onset and spermatozoa can be infectious Since October  the CDC has advised men who have traveled to an area with Zika should use condoms or not have sex for at least six months after their return as the virus is still transmissible even if symptoms never develop
Zika virus can spread by vertical or "mothertochild" transmission during pregnancy or at delivery An infection during pregnancy has been linked to changes in neuronal development of the unborn child Severe progressions of infection have been linked to the development of microcephaly in the unborn child while mild infections potentially can lead to neurocognitive disorders later in life Congenital brain abnormalities other than microcephaly have also been reported after a Zika outbreak Studies in mice have suggested that maternal immunity to dengue virus may enhance fetal infection with Zika worsen the microcephaly phenotype andor enhance damage during pregnancy but it is unknown whether this occurs in humans 
As of April update two cases of Zika transmission through blood transfusions have been reported globally both from Brazil after which the US Food and Drug Administration FDA recommended screening blood donors and deferring highrisk donors for  weeks A potential risk had been suspected based on a blooddonor screening study during the French Polynesian Zika outbreak in which   of donors from November  and February  tested positive for Zika RNA and were all asymptomatic at the time of blood donation Eleven of the positive donors reported symptoms of Zika fever after their donation but only three of  samples grew in culture
Zika virus replicates in the mosquitos midgut epithelial cells and then its salivary gland cells After – days the virus can be found in the mosquitos saliva If the mosquitos saliva is inoculated into human skin the virus can infect epidermal keratinocytes skin fibroblasts in the skin and the Langerhans cells The pathogenesis of the virus is hypothesized to continue with a spread to lymph nodes and the bloodstream Flaviviruses replicate in the cytoplasm but Zika antigens have been found in infected cell nuclei
The viral protein numbered NSA can lead to small head size microcephaly because it disrupts brain growth by hijacking a pathway which regulates growth of new neurons In fruit flies both NSA and the neighboring NSB restrict eye growth
Zika fever also known as Zika virus disease is an illness caused by Zika virus Most cases have no symptoms but when present they are usually mild and can resemble dengue fever Symptoms may include fever red eyes joint pain headache and a maculopapular rash Symptoms generally last less than seven days It has not caused any reported deaths during the initial infection Infection during pregnancy causes microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies Infection in adults has been linked to Guillain–Barré syndrome GBS and Zika virus has been shown to infect human Schwann cells
Diagnosis is by testing the blood urine or saliva for the presence of Zika virus RNA when the person is sick In  an improved diagnostic test based on research from Washington University in St Louis that detects Zika infection in serum was granted market authorization by the FDA
Prevention involves decreasing mosquito bites in areas where the disease occurs and proper use of condoms Efforts to prevent bites include the use of DEET or picaridin  based insect repellent covering much of the body with clothing mosquito nets and getting rid of standing water where mosquitoes reproduce There is no vaccine Health officials recommended that women in areas affected by the – Zika outbreak consider putting off pregnancy and that pregnant women not travel to these areas While no specific treatment exists paracetamol acetaminophen and rest may help with the symptoms Admission to a hospital is rarely necessary
The World Health Organization has suggested that priority should be to develop inactivated vaccines and other nonlive vaccines which are safe to use in pregnant women
As of March update  companies and institutions were developing vaccines against Zika but they state a vaccine is unlikely to be widely available for about  years
In June  the FDA granted the first approval for a human clinical trial for a Zika vaccine In March  a DNA vaccine was approved for phase clinical trials This vaccine consists of a small circular piece of DNA known as a plasmid that expresses the genes for the Zika virus envelope proteins As the vaccine does not contain the full sequence of the virus it cannot cause infection As of April  both subunit and inactivated vaccines have entered clinical trials
The virus was first isolated in April  from a rhesus macaque monkey placed in a cage in the Ziika Forest of Uganda near Lake Victoria by the scientists of the Yellow Fever Research Institute A second isolation from the mosquito A africanus followed at the same site in January  When the monkey developed a fever researchers isolated from its serum a "filterable transmissible agent" which was named Zika in 
Zika was first known to infect humans from the results of a serological survey in Uganda published in  Of  human blood samples tested  had neutralizing antibodies As part of a  outbreak investigation of jaundice suspected to be yellow fever researchers reported isolation of the virus from a patient but the pathogen was later shown to be the closely related Spondweni virus Spondweni was also determined to be the cause of a selfinflicted infection in a researcher reported in 
Subsequent serological studies in several African and Asian countries indicated the virus had been widespread within human populations in these regions The first true case of human infection was identified by Simpson in  who was himself infected while isolating the virus from mosquitoes From then until  there were only  further confirmed human cases of Zika infection from Africa and Southeast Asia A study published in  showed that the Zika virus despite only a few cases were reported has been silently circulated in West Africa for the last two decades when blood samples collected between  and  were tested for the ZIKV IgM antibodies
In April  the first outbreak outside of Africa and Asia occurred on the island of Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia characterized by rash conjunctivitis and arthralgia which was initially thought to be dengue chikungunya or Ross River disease Serum samples from patients in the acute phase of illness contained RNA of Zika There were  confirmed cases  unconfirmed cases no hospitalizations and no deaths
After October  Oceanias first outbreak showed an estimated  population infected for French Polynesia that also presented with Guillain–Barre syndrome GBS The spread of ZIKV continued to New Caledonia Easter Island and the Cook Islands and where  cases were confirmed by January  During the same year Easter Island acknowledged  cases Australia began seeing cases in  Research showed it was brought by travelers returning from Indonesia and other infected countries New Zealand also experienced infections rate increases through returning foreign travelers Oceania countries experiencing Zika today are New Caledonia Vanuatu Solomon Islands Marshall Islands American Samoa Samoa and Tonga
Between  and  further epidemics occurred in French Polynesia Easter Island the Cook Islands and New Caledonia
There was an epidemic in  and  in the Americas The outbreak began in April  in Brazil and spread to other countries in South America Central America North America and the Caribbean In January  the WHO said the virus was likely to spread throughout most of the Americas by the end of the year and in February  the WHO declared the cluster of microcephaly and Guillain–Barré syndrome cases reported in Brazil – strongly suspected to be associated with the Zika outbreak – a Public Health Emergency of International Concern It was estimated that  million people were infected by Zika in Brazil with over  cases of microcephaly reported between October  and January 
A number of countries issued travel warnings and the outbreak was expected to significantly impact the tourism industry Several countries have taken the unusual step of advising their citizens to delay pregnancy until more is known about the virus and its impact on fetal development With the  Summer Olympics hosted in Rio de Janeiro health officials worldwide voiced concerns over a potential crisis both in Brazil and when international athletes and tourists returned home and possibly would spread the virus Some researchers speculated that only one or two tourists might be infected during the threeweek period or approximately  infections per  tourists In November  the World Health Organization declared that Zika virus was no longer a global emergency while noting that the virus still represents "a highly significant and a longterm problem"
As of August  the number of new Zika virus cases in the Americas had fallen dramatically
On May   three cases of Zika virus infection in India were reported in the state of Gujarat By late  there had been at least  cases in Rajasthan and  in Madhya Pradesh
In July  the first case of Zika virus infection in the Indian state of Kerala was reported After the first confirmed case  other people who had previously presented symptoms were tested and  of those had positive results showing that Zika had been circulating in Kerala since at least May  By August th  there had been  reported cases in Kerala
In October   an officer in the Indian Air Force in Kanpur tested positive for Zika virus making it the first reported case in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh
On  March  Reuters reported that Zika was isolated from a  blood sample of an elderly man in Chittagong in Bangladesh as part of a retrospective study Zika is also occurring in Tanzania as of 
Between August and November   cases of Zika virus infection were confirmed in Singapore
In  Angola reported two cases of Zika fever
