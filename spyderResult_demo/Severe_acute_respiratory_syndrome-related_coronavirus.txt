Severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus SARSrCoV or SARSCoVnote  is a species of virus consisting of many known strains phylogenetically related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  SARSCoV that have been shown to possess the capability to infect humans bats and certain other mammals These enveloped positivesense singlestranded RNA viruses enter host cells by binding to the angiotensinconverting enzyme  ACE receptor The SARSrCoV species is a member of the genus Betacoronavirus and of the subgenus Sarbecovirus SARS Betacoronavirus
Two strains of the virus have caused outbreaks of severe respiratory diseases in humans severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  SARSCoV or SARSCoV which caused the – outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  SARSCoV which is causing the ongoing pandemic of COVID There are hundreds of other strains of SARSrCoV which are only known to infect nonhuman species bats are a major reservoir of many strains of SARSrCoV several strains have been identified in palm civets which were likely ancestors of SARSCoV
The SARSrelated coronavirus was one of several viruses identified by the World Health Organization WHO in  as a likely cause of a future epidemic in a new plan developed after the Ebola epidemic for urgent research and development before and during an epidemic towards diagnostic tests vaccines and medicines This prediction came to pass with the COVID pandemic
SARSrelated coronavirus is a member of the genus Betacoronavirus group  and monotypic of the subgenus Sarbecovirus subgroup B  Sarbecoviruses unlike embecoviruses or alphacoronaviruses have only one papainlike proteinase PLpro instead of two in the open reading frame ORFab SARSrCoV was determined to be an early splitoff from the betacoronaviruses based on a set of conserved domains that it shares with the group
Bats serve as the main host reservoir species for the SARSrelated coronaviruses like SARSCoV and SARSCoV The virus has coevolved in the bat host reservoir over a long period of time Only recently have strains of SARSrelated coronavirus been observed to have evolved into having been able to make the crossspecies jump from bats to humans as in the case of the strains SARSCoV and SARSCoV Both of these strains descended from a single ancestor but made the crossspecies jump into humans separately SARSCoV is not a direct descendant of SARSCoV
The SARSrelated coronavirus is an enveloped positivesense singlestranded RNA virus Its genome is about  kb which is one of the largest among RNA viruses The virus has  open reading frames which overlap in some cases The genome has the usual ′ methylated cap and a ′ polyadenylated tail There are  nucleotides in the UTR and  nucleotides in the UTR
The  methylated cap and  polyadenylated tail allows the positivesense RNA genome to be directly translated by the host cells ribosome on viral entry SARSrCoV is similar to other coronaviruses in that its genome expression starts with translation by the host cells ribosomes of its initial two large overlapping open reading frames ORFs a and b both of which produce polyproteins
The functions of several of the viral proteins are known ORFs a and b encode the replicasetranscriptase polyprotein and later ORFs    and a encode respectively the four major structural proteins spike S envelope E membrane M and nucleocapsid N The later ORFs also encode for eight unique proteins orfa to orfb known as the accessory proteins many with no known homologues The different functions of the accessory proteins are not well understood
SARS coronaviruses have been genetically engineered in several laboratories
Phylogenetic analysis showed that the evolutionary branch composed of Bat coronavirus BtKY and BM was the base group of SARS–related CoVs evolutionary tree which separated from other SARS–related CoVs earlier than SARSCoV and SARSCoV

The morphology of the SARSrelated coronavirus is characteristic of the coronavirus family as a whole The viruses are large pleomorphic spherical particles with bulbous surface projections that form a corona around the particles in electron micrographs The size of the virus particles is in the – nm range The envelope of the virus in electron micrographs appears as a distinct pair of electron dense shells
The viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer where the membrane M envelope E and spike S proteins are anchored The spike proteins provide the virus with its bulbous surface projections known as peplomers The spike proteins interaction with its complement host cell receptor is central in determining the tissue tropism infectivity and species range of the virus
Inside  the envelope there is the nucleocapsid which is formed from multiple copies of the nucleocapsid N protein which are bound to the positivesense singlestranded  kb RNA genome in a continuous beadsonastring type conformation The lipid bilayer envelope membrane proteins and nucleocapsid protect the virus  when it is outside the host
SARSrelated coronavirus follows the replication strategy typical of all coronaviruses
The attachment of the SARSrelated coronavirus to the host cell is mediated by the spike protein and its receptor The spike protein receptor binding domain RBD recognizes and attaches to the angiotensinconverting enzyme  ACE receptor Following attachment the virus can enter the host cell by two different paths The path the virus takes depends on the host protease available to cleave and activate the receptorattached spike protein
The attachment of sarbecoviruses to ACE has been shown to be an evolutionarily conserved feature present in many species of the taxon 
The first path the SARS coronavirus can take to enter the host cell is by endocytosis and uptake of the virus in an endosome The receptorattached spike protein is then activated by the hosts pHdependent cysteine protease cathepsin L Activation of the receptorattached spike protein causes a conformational change and the subsequent fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal wall
Alternatively the virus can enter the host cell directly by proteolytic cleavage of the receptorattached spike protein by the hosts TMPRSS or TMPRSSD serine proteases at the cell surface In the SARS coronavirus the activation of the Cterminal part of the spike protein triggers the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane by inducing conformational changes which are not fully understood
After fusion the nucleocapsid passes into the cytoplasm where the viral genome is released The genome acts as a messenger RNA and the cells ribosome translates twothirds of the genome which corresponds to the open reading frame ORFa and ORFb into two large overlapping polyproteins ppa and ppab
The larger polyprotein ppab is a result of a  ribosomal frameshift caused by a slippery sequence UUUAAAC and a downstream RNA pseudoknot at the end of open reading frame ORFa The ribosomal frameshift allows for the continuous translation of ORFa followed by ORFb
The polyproteins contain their own proteases  PLpro and CLpro which cleave the polyproteins at different specific sites The cleavage of polyprotein ppab yields  nonstructural proteins nsp to nsp Product proteins include various replication  proteins such as RNAdependent RNA polymerase RdRp RNA helicase and exoribonuclease ExoN
The two SARSCoV proteases PLpro and CLpro also interfere with the immune system response to the viral infection by cleaving three immune system proteins PLpro cleaves IRF and CLpro cleaves both NLRP and TAB "Direct cleavage of IRF by NSP could explain the blunted TypeI IFN response seen during SARSCoV infections while NSP mediated cleavage of NLRP and TAB point to a molecular mechanism for enhanced production of IL and inflammatory response observed in COVID patients"
A number of the nonstructural replication proteins coalesce to form a multiprotein replicasetranscriptase complex RTC The main replicasetranscriptase protein is the RNAdependent RNA polymerase RdRp It is directly involved in the replication and transcription of RNA from an RNA strand The other nonstructural proteins in the complex assist in the replication and transcription process
The protein nsp is a  exoribonuclease which provides extra fidelity to the replication process The exoribonuclease provides a proofreading function to the complex which the RNAdependent RNA polymerase lacks Similarly proteins nsp and nsp form a hexadecameric sliding clamp as part of the complex which greatly increases the processivity of the RNAdependent RNA polymerase The coronaviruses require the increased fidelity and processivity during RNA synthesis because of the relatively large genome size in comparison to other RNA viruses
One of the main functions of the replicasetranscriptase complex is to transcribe the viral genome RdRp directly mediates the synthesis of  negativesense subgenomic RNA molecules from the positivesense genomic RNA This is followed by the transcription of these negativesense subgenomic RNA molecules to their corresponding positivesense mRNAs
The other important function of the replicasetranscriptase complex is to replicate the viral genome RdRp directly mediates the synthesis of negativesense genomic RNA from the positivesense genomic RNA This is followed by the replication of positivesense genomic RNA from the negativesense genomic RNA
The replicated positivesense genomic RNA becomes the genome of the progeny viruses The various smaller mRNAs are transcripts from the last third of the virus genome which follows the reading frames ORFa and ORFb These mRNAs are translated into the four structural proteins S E M and N that will become part of the progeny virus particles and also eight other accessory proteins orf to orfb which assist the virus
When two SARSCoV genomes are present in a host cell they may interact with each other to form recombinant genomes that can be transmitted to progeny viruses  Recombination likely occurs during genome replication when the RNA polymerase switches from one template to another copy choice recombination  Human SARSCoV appears to have had a complex history of recombination between ancestral coronaviruses that were hosted in several different animal groups
RNA translation occurs  inside the endoplasmic reticulum The viral structural proteins S  E and M  move along the secretory pathway into the Golgi intermediate compartment There the M proteins direct most proteinprotein interactions required for assembly of viruses following its binding to the nucleocapsid
Progeny viruses are released from the host cell by exocytosis through secretory vesicles
