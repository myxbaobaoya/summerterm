Kaposis sarcomaassociated herpesvirus KSHV is the ninth known human herpesvirus its formal name according to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ICTV is Human gammaherpesvirus  or HHV in short Like other herpesviruses its informal names are used interchangeably with its formal ICTV name This virus causes Kaposis sarcoma a cancer commonly occurring in AIDS patients as well as primary effusion lymphoma HHVassociated multicentric Castlemans disease and KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome It is one of seven currently known human cancer viruses or oncoviruses Even after so many years of discovery of KSHVHHV there is no known cure for KSHV associated tumorigenesis
In  Moritz Kaposi described a blood vessel tumor originally called "idiopathic multiple pigmented sarcoma of the skin" that has since been eponymously named Kaposis sarcoma KS KS was at first thought to be an uncommon tumor of Jewish and Mediterranean populations until it was later determined to be extremely common throughout subSaharan African populations This led to the first suggestions in the s that this tumor might be caused by a virus With the onset of the AIDS epidemic in the early s there was a sudden resurgence of KS affecting AIDS patients with up to  of reported AIDS patients having this tumoran extraordinary rate of cancer predispositioncitation needed
Careful analysis of epidemiologic data by Valerie Beral Thomas Peterman and Harold Jaffe led these investigators to propose that KS is caused by an unknown sexually transmitted virus that rarely causes tumors unless the host becomes immunosuppressed as in AIDScitation needed
As early as  scientists reported seeing herpesviruslike structures in KS tumors examined under electron microscopy Scientists had been searching for the agent causing KS and over  agents were proposed as the possible cause including cytomegalovirus and HIV itself The pathogen was ultimately identified in  by Yuan Chang and Patrick S Moore a wife and husband team at Columbia University through the isolation of DNA fragments from a herpesvirus found in a KS tumor in an AIDS patient Chang and Moore used representational difference analysis or RDA to find KSHV by comparing KS tumor tissue from an AIDS patient to his own unaffected tissue The idea behind this experiment was that if a virus causes KS the genomic DNA in the two samples should be precisely identical except for DNA belonging to the virus In their initial RDA experiment they isolated two small DNA fragments that represented less than  of the actual viral genome These fragments were similar but still distinct from the known herpevirus sequences indicating the presence of a new virus Starting from these fragments this research team was then able to sequence the entire genome of the virus less than two years latercitation needed
The discovery of this herpesvirus sparked considerable controversy and scientific infighting until sufficient data had been collected to show that indeed KSHV was the causative agent of Kaposis sarcoma  The virus is now known to be a widespread infection of people living in subSaharan Africa intermediate levels of infection occur in Mediterranean populations including Lebanon Saudi Arabia Italy and Greece and low levels of infection occur in most Northern European and North American populations  Gay and bisexual men are more susceptible to infection through still unknown routes of sexual transmission whereas the virus is transmitted through nonsexual routes in developing countriescitation needed
KSHV is a herpesvirus and is a large doublestranded DNA virus with a protein covering that packages its nucleic acids called the capsid which is then surrounded by an amorphous protein layer called the tegument and finally enclosed in a lipid envelope derived in part from the cell membrane KSHV has a genome which is approximately  nucleic acid bases in length The viral genome consists of a  kilobaselong unique region encoding all of expressed viral genes which is flanked by  kilobases of terminal repeat sequences 
Each terminal repeat unit is  bp in length has  GC content and is oriented in a repetitive headtotail fashion KSHV is a rhadinovirus a Herpes genus remarkable since it has stolen numerous genes from host cells including in the case of KSHV genes that encode for complementbinding protein IL BCL cyclinD a G proteincoupled receptor interferon regulatory factor and Flice inhibitory protein FLIP as well as DNA synthesis proteins including dihydrofolate reductase thymidine kinase thymidylate synthetase DNA polymerase and many others While no other human tumor virus possesses these same genes other tumor viruses target the same cellular pathways illustrating that at a basic level all tumor viruses appear to attack the same cellular control pathways socalled tumor suppressor pathwayscitation needed
Crucial for the entry of KSHV into cells

are the EPH receptor A 
Hrs 
TSG 
and a few integrins whose identity has yet to be confirmed 
After infection the virus enters into lymphocytes via macropinosomescitation needed
Once the virus newly infects a cell the lipid membrane is shed and the virion travels to the nucleus The viral genome is released where it circularizes into an episome through a poorly understood process that appears to involve homologous recombination of the terminal repeatscitation needed The viral episome is chromatinized upon entry into the host cell nucleus
After entry the virus typically remains in a latent "quiet" state Only a subset of genes that are encoded in the KSHV latency associated region KLAR are expressed during latency including latencyassociated nuclear antigen LANA vFLIP vCyclin and  microRNAs  Latency is the hallmark of all KSHVassociated etiologies known to date including all KSHVassociated oncogenesis It has been shown that both protein coding genes such as LANA and noncoding genes microRNAs encoded in KLAR are important for KSHV associated tumorigenesis To study the functions of microRNAs a detailed protocol of bacmid mutagenesis and a complete set of celllines carrying microRNA deletion mutants have been established and are available as a resource to researchers 
Additionally it has been shown that vFLIP and vCyclin interfere with the TGFÎ² signaling pathway indirectly by inducing the oncogenic host mir cluster These observations represents a novel mechanism that may be important for KSHV tumorigenesis and angiogenesis a hallmark of KS
During latency LANA is the only viral protein that is required for viral replication which is carried out by the host replication machinery LANA tethers the viral DNA to cellular chromosomes inhibits p and retinoblastoma protein and suppresses viral genes needed for full virus production and assembly "lytic replication" Why only a subset of virus genes expressed during latency is not fully understood But it has been shown that the latency associated gene expression can be explained in part by a characteristic epigenetic state that KSHV episome acquires during latency LANA plays an important role during latency regulating both host and virus transcripts and binding to multiple active promoters it also associates with the host protein hSET that creates HKme marks in chromatin 
Various signals such as inflammation may provoke the virus to enter into lytic replication The primary viral protein responsible for the switch between latent and lytic replication is known as the ORF Replication Transactivation Activator RTA  When cell signaling conditions activate the generation of RTA it in turn activates synthesis of a stereotypic cascade of secondary and tertiary viral proteins that ultimately make components of the virus capsid and also the DNA synthesis enzymes required to replicate the virus genome 
During lytic replication it is believed that the virus genome is replicated as a continuous linear molecule off of an episome socalled rolling circle model As each unit genome is replicated it is cut within the terminal repeat region and then packaged into a virus particle virion The virus then becomes enveloped with a lipid membrane as it transits the nucleus and the cytoplasm to exit the cell Thus whereas KSHV genome is circular in the nucleus of latently infected cells it is packaged into infectious viruses as a linear molecule When the virus enters into lytic replication thousands of virus particles can be made from a single cell which usually results in death of the infected cellcitation needed
It was discovered in  that infection with the SARSCoV virus the virus which causes COVID may induce the lytic reactivation of KSHV in the human body causing the herpes virus to cease latency and begin the formation of cancerous cells  Further it was discovered that some medications used to treat the infection with SARSCoV namely Nafamostat and Azithromycin ended up promoting the production of mature virions " potentially inducing KSHV lytic reactivation"
The mechanisms by which the virus is contracted are not well understood Healthy individuals can be infected with the virus and show no signs or symptoms due to the immune systems ability to keep the infection in check Infection is of particular concern to the immunocompromised Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy AIDS patients and organ transplant patients are all at a high risk of showing signs of infectioncitation needed
Recent advances in sequencing technologies have uncovered that virus is chromatinized during latency It has also been shown that virus encoded microRNA  manipulates and interacts not only with host mRNA but also deregulate host long noncoding RNA lncRNA More recently circularRNAs circRNAs are recently discovered in both EBV and KSHV 
Infection with this virus is thought to be lifelong but a healthy immune system will keep the virus in check Many people infected with KSHV will never show any symptoms Kaposis sarcoma occurs when someone who has been infected with KSHV becomes immunocompromised due to AIDS medical treatment or very rarely aging
KSHV is a known causative agent of four diseases
In the s the global prevalence rate for HHV is  to  The seroprevalence of HHV varies significantly geographically and infection rates in northern European southeast Asian and Caribbean countries are between  in Mediterranean countries at approximately  and in subSaharan African countries at approximately  In South America infection rates are low in general but are high among Amerindians Even within individual countries significant variation can be observed across different regions with infection rates of about  in Xinjiang compared to about  in Hubei China Although seroprevalence has been consistently shown to increase with age in a linear manner countries with high infection rates may see higher seroprevalence in younger age groups Educational level has shown an inverse correlation with infection rates Individuals infected with HIV or genital warts are generally more likely to be coinfected with HHV
In countries with low seroprevalence HHV is primarily limited to AIDS and KS patients In countries with high seroprevalence infection is frequent in childhood indicating a likely mothertochild transmission by saliva In a Zambian survey all children with KS had mothers who were positive for HHV whereas not all children whose mothers had KS were HHV positive In another Zambian survey  of children were seropositive for HHV by age  Seroprevalence has not been shown to vary significantly because of gender or marital status
The most recent common ancestor of this virus in the Mediterranean Iran and Xinjiang China has been estimated to have evolved  years  highest probability density  years ago the most recent common ancestor for viruses isolated in Xinjiang was  years  highest probability density â years ago Given the historical links between the Mediterranean and Xinjiang during the Roman period it seems likely that this virus was introduced to Xinjiang along the Silk Road The mutation rate was estimated to be   Ã â substitutions per site per year  highest probability density  Ã  to  Ã â However the global distribution of different genotypes of KSHV and the potential transmission path need further studiescitation needed
Typing of isolates is based on the variable K membrane protein Six types are recognised AF
Since persons infected with KSHV will asymptomatically give the virus caution should be used by sex partners in having unprotected sex and activities where saliva might be shared during sexual activity Prudent advice is to use condoms when needed and avoid deep kissing with partners with KSHV and HIV infections or whose status is unknown
Kaposis sarcoma is usually a localized tumor that can be treated either surgically or through local irradiation Chemotherapy with drugs such as liposomal anthracyclines or paclitaxel may be used particularly for invasive disease Antiviral drugs such as ganciclovir that target the replication of herpesviruses such as KSHV have been used to successfully prevent development of Kaposis sarcoma although once the tumor develops these drugs are of little or no use For patients with AIDSKS the most effective therapy is highly active antiretroviral therapy to reduce HIV infection AIDS patients receiving adequate antiHIV treatment may have up to a  reduction in Kaposis sarcoma occurrence
Although KSHV affects the host immune system there is ample chance for clinical intervention to recover this change One challenge is overexpression inhibitory of target cell repress immune Under longtime inflammation stimulation the target cell becomes unable to respond which leads to an exhausted phenotype The activation immunotherapies can revive and enhance immune cell function Comparing to other immunotherapies therapies targeting the antiprogrammed cell death protein  PDprogrammed deathligand  PDL has been a great success Because of KSHV infection the monocytes increase the expression of PD which is an inhibitory molecule and cause immune escape in many tumor types There is high PD expression in NK cells from KSHIV patients and cause exhausted phenotype The antiPD antibody nivolumab or pembrolizumab demonstrated a significant antitumor effect Nivolumab is currently an ongoing phase I clinical trial and Pembrolizumab has shown its function in treatment for HIV and KS patients in phase I and is in a phase II trial for treatment A thalidomide analog medicine  Pomalidomide was also granted by the FDA in  Pomalidomide was shown to recover the expression of MHC which help cell display intracellular proteins to cytotoxic T cells and it also can repress the expression of PDL and increase the CD T cell killing
