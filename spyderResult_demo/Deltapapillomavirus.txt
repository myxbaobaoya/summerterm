Deltapapillomavirus is a genus of viruses in the family Papillomaviridae Ruminants serve as natural hosts There are seven species in this genus Diseases associated with this genus include warts papillomas and fibropapillomas of the skin and alimentary tract rarely cancers of the alimentary tract and urinary bladder possibly responsible for the skin tumour equine sarcoid in horses and donkeys
The following seven species are assigned to the genus
Viruses in Deltapapillomavirus are nonenveloped with icosahedral geometries The diameter is around Â nm Genomes are circular around kb in length
Viral replication is nuclear Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral proteins to host receptors which mediates endocytosis Replication follows the dsDNA bidirectional replication model Dna templated transcription with some alternative splicing mechanism is the method of transcription The virus exits the host cell by nuclear envelope breakdown
Ruminants serve as the natural host Transmission routes are contact
