Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever CCHF is a viral disease Symptoms of CCHF may include fever muscle pains headache vomiting diarrhea and bleeding into the skin Onset of symptoms is less than two weeks following exposure Complications may include liver failure In those who survive recovery generally occurs around two weeks after onset
The CCHF virus is typically spread by tick bites or close contact with the blood secretions organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons or animals Groups that are at high risk of infection are farmers and those who work in slaughterhouses The virus can also spread between people via body fluids Diagnosis can be made by detecting antibodies the viruss RNA or viral proteins antigens It is a type of viral hemorrhagic fever
There are no FDA or WHOapproved therapeutics for CCHF Prevention involves avoiding tick bites using safe practices in meat processing plants and observing universal healthcare precautions A vaccine is not commercially available Treatment is typically with supportive care The medication ribavirin may also help
CCHF cases are observed in a wide geographic range including Africa Russia the Balkans the Middle East and Asia Typically small outbreaks are seen in areas where the virus is endemic In  Iran Russia Turkey and Uzbekistan documented more than  cases The fatality rate is typically between  and  though fatalities as high as  have been observed in some outbreaks The virus was first observed in Crimea in the s and was later identified as the same agent of what had been called Congo Hemorrhagic Fever
 In the past  years CCHF outbreaks have reported in Eastern Europe particularly in the former Soviet Union throughout the Mediterranean in northwestern China central Asia southern Europe Africa the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent  CCHF is on WHOs priority list for Research and Development and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIHNIAID priority A list as a disease posing the highest level of risk to national security and public health
The clinical illness associated with CCHFV is a severe form of hemorrhagic fever Following infection by a tick bite the incubation period is typically two to three days but can last as long as nine days while the incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually five to six days with a documented maximum of  days  The onset of symptoms ushering in the prehemmorhagic phase is sudden with fever myalgia muscle ache dizziness neck pain and stiffness backache headache Suhash disease sore eyes and photophobia sensitivity to light Typical symptoms include nausea vomiting which may progress to severe bleeding and can be fatal if not treated diarrhea abdominal pain and sore throat early in the acute infection phase followed by sharp mood swings agitations and confusion After several days agitation may be replaced by sleepiness depression and lassitude and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant with detectable liver enlargement  As the illness progresses into the hemorrhagic phase large areas of severe bruising severe nosebleeds and uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites can be seen beginning on about the fourth day of illness and lasting for about two weeks Other clinical signs include tachycardia fast heart rate lymphadenopathy enlarged lymph nodes and a petechiae a rash caused by bleeding into the skin on internal mucosal surfaces such as in the mouth and throat and on the skin The petechiae may give way to larger rashes called ecchymoses and other haemorrhagic phenomena There is usually evidence of hepatitis and severely ill patients may experience rapid kidney deterioration liver failure or pulmonary failure after the fifth day of illness
In documented outbreaks of CCHF fatality rates in hospitalized patients have ranged from  to as high as  though the WHO notes a typical range of  with death often occurring in the second week of illness In patients who recover improvement generally begins on the ninth or tenth day after the onset of illness The longterm effects of CCHF infection have not been studied well enough in survivors to determine whether or not specific complications exist However recovery is slow
The CrimeanCongo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus CCHFV is a member of the genus Orthonairovirus family Nairoviridae of RNA viruses
The virions are – nanometers nm in diameter and are pleomorphic There are no host ribosomes within the virion Each virion contains three distinct RNA sequences which together make up the viral genome The envelope is single layered and is formed from a lipid bilayer  nm thick It has no external protrusions The envelope proteins form small projections – nm long The nucleocapsids are filamentous and circular with a length of – nm
Viral entry is thought to be clathrinmediated with the cell surface protein nucleolin playing a role
The genome is circular negative sense RNA in three parts – Small S Medium M and Large L The L segment is – kilobases in length while the M and S segments are – and – kilobases long respectively The L segment encodes the RNA polymerase the M segment encodes the envelope glycoproteins Gc and Gn and the S segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein The mutation rates for the three parts of the genome were estimated to be ×− ×− and ×− substitutionssiteyear for the S M and L segments respectively
CCHFV is the most genetically diverse of the arboviruses Its nucleotide sequences frequently differ between different strains ranging from a  variability for the viral S segment to  for the M segment Viruses with diverse sequences can be found within the same geographic area closely related viruses have been isolated from widely separated regions suggesting that viral dispersion has occurred possibly by ticks carried on migratory birds or through international livestock trade Reassortment among genome segments during coinfection of ticks or vertebrates seems likely to have played a role in generating diversity in this viruscitation needed
Based on the sequence data seven genotypes of CCHFV have been recognised Africa  Senegal Africa  Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Africa Africa  southern and western Africa Europe  Albania Bulgaria Kosovo Russia and Turkey Europe  Greece Asia  the Middle East Iran and Pakistan and Asia  China Kazakhstan Tajikistan and Uzbekistancitation needed
Ticks are both "environmental reservoir" and vector for the virus carrying it from wild animals to domestic animals and humans Tick species identified as infected with the virus include Argas reflexus Hyalomma anatolicum Hyalomma detritum Hyalomma marginatum marginatum and Rhipicephalus sanguineuscitation needed
At least  different species of ticks from the genera Haemaphysalis and Hyalomma in southeastern Iran have been found to carry the virus
Wild animals and small mammals particularly European hare MiddleAfrican hedgehogs and multimammate rats are the "amplifying hosts" of the virus Birds are generally resistant to CCHF with the exception of ostriches Domestic animals like sheep goats and cattle can develop high titers of virus in their blood but tend not to fall ill
The "sporadic infection" of humans is usually caused by a Hyalomma tick bite Animals can transmit the virus to humans but this would usually be as part of a disease cluster When clusters of illness occur it is typically after people treat butcher or eat infected livestock particularly ruminants and ostriches Outbreaks have occurred in abattoirs and other places where workers have been exposed to infected human or animal blood and fomitescitation needed Humans can infect humans and outbreaks also occur in clinical facilities through infected blood and unclean medical instruments
Where mammalian tick infection is common agricultural regulations require deticking farm animals before transportation or delivery for slaughter Personal tick avoidance measures are recommended such as use of insect repellents adequate clothing and body inspection for adherent tickscitation needed
When feverish patients with evidence of bleeding require resuscitation or intensive care body substance isolation precautions should be takencitation needed
Since the s several vaccine trials around the world against CCHF have been terminated due to high toxicity
As of March update the only available and probably somewhat efficacious CCHF vaccine has been an inactivated antigen preparation then used in Bulgaria No publication in the scientific literature related to this vaccine exists which a Turkish virologist called suspicious both because antiquated technology and mouse brain were used to manufacture it 
More vaccines are under development but the sporadic nature of the disease even in endemic countries suggests that large trials of vaccine efficacy will be difficult to perform Finding volunteers may prove challenging given growing antivaccination sentiment and resistance of populations to vaccination against contagious diseases The number of people to be vaccinated and the length of time they would have to be followed to confirm protection would have to be carefully defined Alternatively many scientists appear to believe that treatment of CCHF with ribavirin is more practical than prevention but some recently conducted clinical trials appear to counter assumptions of drug efficacy
In  a Turkish research team led by Erciyes University successfully developed the first nontoxic preventive vaccine which passed clinical trials As of  the vaccine was pending approval by the US FDA
Since the Ebola epidemic the WHO jumpstarted a "Blueprint for Research and Development preparedness" on emerging pathogens with epidemic potential against which there are no medical treatments CCHF was the top priority on the initial list from December  and is second as of January 
Treatment is mostly supportive Ribavirin has shown some efficacy in vitro and has been used by mouth during outbreakscitation needed but there is uncertain evidence to support its use and this medication can cause serious side effects including hemolytic anemia and liver damage
As of update the use of Immunoglobulin preparations has remained unproven and antibody engineering which raised hopes for monoclonal antibody therapy has remained in its infancy
CCHF occurs most frequently among agricultural workers following the bite of an infected tick and to a lesser extent among slaughterhouse workers exposed to the blood and tissues of infected livestock and medical personnel through contact with the body fluids of infected persons
As of update the northern limit of CCHF has been  degrees northern latitude north of which the Hyalomma ticks have not been found
Per a WHO map from  Hyalomma ticks occurred south of this latitude across all of the Eurasian continent and Africa sparing only the islands of Sri Lanka Indonesia and Japan 
Serological or virological evidence of CCHF was widespread in Asia Eastern Europe the Middle East except Israel Lebanon and Jordan central Africa Western Africa South Africa and Madagascar
In  more than  casesyear were reported from only  countries Turkey Iran Russia and Uzbekistan  casesyear were present in South Africa Central Asia including Pakistan and Afghanistan but sparing Turkmenistan in the Middle East only the UAE and the Balkan countries limited to Romania Bulgaria Serbia Montenegro and KosovoAlbania
In Russia the disease is limited to Southern and North Caucasian Federal Districts but climate change may cause it to spread into more northerly areas
A  map by the CDC shows endemic areas in red largely unchanged in Africa and the Middle East but different for the Balkan including all countries of the former Yugoslavia and also Greece but no longer Romania Indias Northwestern regions of Rajastan and Gujarat saw their first cases

In September  an outbreak was reported in Pakistans Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province Poor diagnosis and record keeping caused the extent of the outbreak to be uncertain though some reports indicated over  cases with a casefatality rate above citation needed
In January  the first human cases of CCHF in India was reported in Sanand Gujarat India with  reported deaths which included the index patient treating physician and nurse
As of May update  people were reported to have contracted the disease in Iran resulting in  fatalitiescitation needed
In October  a British man died from the disease at the Royal Free Hospital in London He had earlier been admitted to Gartnavel General Hospital in Glasgow after returning on a flight from Kabul in Afghanistan
In July  seven persons died due to CCHF in Kariyana village in Babra taluka Amreli district Gujarat India
In August  a farmer from Agago Uganda was treated at Kalongo Hospital for a confirmed CCHF infection The deaths of three other individuals in the northern region were suspected to have been caused by the virus Another unrelated CCHF patient was admitted to Mulago Hospital on the same day The Ministry of Health announced on the th that the outbreak was under control but the second patient a yearold woman from Nansana died on the st She is believed to have contracted the virus from her husband who returned to Kampala after being treated for CCHF in Juba South Sudan
In June  cases were diagnosed in Kazakhstan Ten people including an ambulance crew were admitted on to hospital in southern Kazakhstan with suspected CCHFcitation needed 
In July  an th person was found to be infected with CCHF at Hayatabad Medical Complex HMC Pakistan The eight patients including a nurse and  Afghan nationals died between April and July 
As of update sporadic confirmed cases have been reported from Bhuj Amreli Sanand ar and Vadnagar in Gujarat India In November  a doctor and a labourer in north Gujarat tested positive for the disease In the following weeks three more people died from CCHF In March  one more person died of CCHF in Gujarat
As of  among livestock CCHF was recognized as "widespread" in India only  years after the first human case had been diagnosed
In August  the first local case of CCHF in Western Europe occurred in Western Spain A yearold man who had been bitten by a tick in Spain died on August  having infected a nurse The tick bite occurred in the province of Ávila  km away from the province of Cáceres where CCHF viral RNA from ticks was amplified in 
As of July update it was unclear what specific ecology led to the Spanish cases
In August  a number of Pakistani news sources raised concerns regarding the disease Between January and October  CCHF outbreaks in Pakistan were reported with highest numbers of cases and deaths during August  just before the festival of EidalAdha held on September – in  It was hypothesized that the festival could play an important part as people could come into contact with domestic or imported animals potentially infected with CCHF virus The Pakistani NIH showed there was no correlation and that CCHF cases
have coincided with the peak tick proliferation during the preceding – years
In  the General Directorate of Public Health in Turkey published official records of infections and casualties of Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever seen between  Hundreds of cases were observed each year with the lowest being  in  and the highest being  in  whereas the mortality rate per population decreasing consistently each year Geographically cases are concentrated in the Central Black Sea Region mostly in Yozgat Province and surrounding provinces mountainous parts of Central Anatolia and northern provinces of Eastern Anatolia
On February   an outbreak occurred in the central region of Mali The infected are from Douentza and Mopti region So far  people have diedneeds update
In  an outbreak occurred in Iraq Between  January and  May  cases of CCHF were reported to the WHO Of the  cases  were suspected and  laboratory confirmed Twenty seven deaths were recorded of which  were in laboratory confirmed cases
In ancient Celtic settlements in the Upper Danube area in Germany the CCHF virus was detected in archaeological blood samples indicating that it was endemic at the time
The virus may have evolved around – BC It is thought that changing climate and agricultural practices around this time could be behind its evolution
In the th century a case of a hemorrhagic disease reported from what is now Tajikistan may have been the first known case of Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fevercitation needed 
During the Crimean War the disease was known as "Crimean fever" and contracted by many including Florence Nightingale
In  Soviet scientists first identified the disease they called Crimean hemorrhagic fever in Crimea They established its viral etiology but were unable to isolate the agent at that time
In February  virologists John P Woodall David Simpson Ghislaine Courtois and others published initial reports on a virus they called the Congo virus In  the Congo virus had first been isolated by physician Ghislaine Courtois head of the Provincial Medical Laboratory Stanleyville in the Belgian Congo Strain V isolated by Courtois was sent to the Rockefeller Foundation Virus Laboratory RFVL in New York City and found to be identical to another strain from Uganda but to no other named virus at that timecitation needed
In June  Soviet virologist Mikhail Chumakov registered an isolate from a fatal case that occurred in Samarkand in the Catalogue of Arthropodborne Viruses
In  the Russian strain which Chumakov had sent to the RFVL was published to be identical to the Congo virus
In  the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses adopted Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus as the official name
These reports include records of the occurrence of the virus or antibodies to the virus from ebola Greece Portugal  South Africa Madagascar the first isolation from there the Maghreb Dubai Saudi Arabia Kuwait and Iraq
