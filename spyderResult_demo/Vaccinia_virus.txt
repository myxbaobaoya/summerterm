Vaccinia virus VACV or VV is a large complex enveloped virus belonging to the poxvirus family It has a linear doublestranded DNA genome approximately  kbp in length which encodes approximately  genes The dimensions of the virion are roughly  ×  ×  nm with a mass of approximately – fg The vaccinia virus is the source of the modern smallpox vaccine which the World Health Organisation used to eradicate smallpox in a global vaccination campaign in – Although smallpox no longer exists in the wild vaccinia virus is still studied widely by scientists as a tool for gene therapy and genetic engineering
Smallpox had been an endemic human disease that had a  fatality rate In  the British doctor Edward Jenner proved that an infection with the relatively mild cowpox virus would also confer immunity to the deadly smallpox Jenner referred to cowpox as variolae vaccinae smallpox of the cow However the origins of the smallpox vaccine became murky over time especially after Louis Pasteur developed laboratory techniques for creating vaccines in the th century Allan Watt Downie demonstrated in  that the modern smallpox vaccine was serologically distinct from cowpox and vaccinia was subsequently recognized as a separate viral species Wholegenome sequencing has revealed that vaccinia is most closely related to horsepox and the cowpox strains found in Great Britain are the least closely related to vaccinia
In addition to the morbidity of uncomplicated primary vaccination transfer of infection to other sites by scratching and  postvaccinial encephalitis other complications of vaccinia infections may be divided into the following types  
Vaccinia virus is closely related to the virus that causes cowpox historically the two were often considered to be one and the same The precise origin of vaccinia virus is unknown due to the lack of recordkeeping as the virus was repeatedly cultivated and passaged in research laboratories for many decades The most common notion is that vaccinia virus cowpox virus and variola virus the causative agent of smallpox were all derived from a common ancestral virus There is also speculation that vaccinia virus was originally isolated from horses and analysis of DNA from an early  sample of smallpox vaccine showed that it was  similar to horsepox virus
Poxviruses are unique among DNA viruses because they replicate only in the cytoplasm of the host cell outside of the nucleus Therefore the large genome is required for encoding various enzymes and proteins involved in viral DNA replication and gene transcription During its replication cycle VV produces four infectious forms which differ in their outer membranes intracellular mature virion IMV the intracellular enveloped virion IEV the cellassociated enveloped virion CEV and the extracellular enveloped virion EEV Although the issue remains contentious the prevailing view is that the IMV consists of a single lipoprotein membrane while the CEV and EEV are both surrounded by two membrane layers and the IEV has three envelopes The IMV is the most abundant infectious form and is thought to be responsible for spread between hosts On the other hand the CEV is believed to play a role in celltocell spread and the EEV is thought to be important for long range dissemination within the host organismcitation needed
Vaccinia virus is able to undergo multiplicity reactivation MR MR is the process by which two or more virus genomes containing otherwise lethal damage interact within an infected cell to form a viable virus genome  Abel found that vaccinia viruses  exposed to doses of UV light sufficient to prevent progeny formation when single virus particles infected host chick embryo cells could still produce viable progeny viruses when host cells were infected by two or more of these inactivated viruses that is MR could occur  Kim and Sharp demonstrated MR of vaccinia virus after treatment with UVlight nitrogen mustard and Xrays or gamma rays  Michod et al reviewed numerous examples of MR in different viruses and suggested that MR is a common form of sexual interaction in viruses that provides the advantage of recombinational repair of genome damagesadditional citations needed
Vaccinia contains within its genome genes for several proteins that give the virus resistance to interferons
Vaccinia virus infection is typically very mild and often does not cause symptoms in healthy individuals although it may cause rash and fever Immune responses generated from a vaccinia virus infection protects the person against a lethal smallpox infection For this reason vaccinia virus was and still is being used as a livevirus vaccine against smallpox Unlike vaccines that use weakened forms of the virus being vaccinated against the vaccinia virus vaccine cannot cause a smallpox infection because it does not contain the smallpox virus However certain complications andor vaccine adverse effects occasionally arise The chance of this happening is significantly increased in people who are immunocompromised Approximately  to  people out of every  million people vaccinated could die as a result of lifethreatening reactions to the vaccination
Currentlywhen the vaccine is only administered to health care workers or research personnel who have a high risk of contracting the variola virus and to the military personnel of the United States Due to the threat of smallpox bioterrorism there is a possibility the vaccine may have to be widely administered again in the future Therefore scientists are currentlywhen developing novel vaccine strategies against smallpox which are safer and much faster to deploy during a bioterrorism event
On September   the US Food and Drug Administration FDA licensed a new vaccine ACAM against smallpox which can be produced quickly upon need Manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stockpiled  million doses of the new vaccine see list of common strains below
A new smallpox vaccine Imvanex which is based on a modified strain of vaccinia Modified vaccinia Ankara was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 
Vaccinia is also used in recombinant vaccines as a vector for expression of foreign genes within a host in order to generate an immune response Other poxviruses are also used as live recombinant vaccines
The original vaccine for smallpox and the origin of the idea of vaccination was Cowpox described by Edward Jenner in  The Latin term used for Cowpox was Variolae vaccinae  Jenners own translation of "smallpox of the cow"  That term lent its name to the whole idea of vaccination  When it was realized that the virus used in smallpox vaccination was not or was no longer the same as cowpox virus the name vaccinia was used for the virus in smallpox vaccine See OED Vaccine potency and efficacy prior to the invention of refrigerated methods of transportation was unreliable The vaccine would be rendered impotent by heat and sunlight and the method of drying samples on quills and shipping them to countries in need often resulted in an inactive vaccine Another method employed was the "arm to arm" method This involved vaccinating an individual then transferring it to another as soon as the infectious pustule forms then to another etc This method was used as a form of living transportation of the vaccine and usually employed orphans as carriers However this method was problematic due to the possibility of spreading other blood diseases such as hepatitis and syphilis as was the case in  when  Italian children contracted syphilis after being vaccinated by the "arm to arm" method Henry Austin Martin introduced a method for vaccine production from calves
In  E Steinhardt C Israeli and R A Lambert grew vaccinia virus in fragments of pig corneal tissue culture
A paper published in  by Fredrick W Twort a student of Willian Bulloch is considered to be the beginning of modern phage research He was attempting to grow vaccinia virus on agar media in the absence of living cells when he noted that many colonies of contaminating micrococci grew up and appeared mucoid watery or glassy and this transformation could be induced in other colonies by inoculation of the fresh colony with material from the watery colony Using a microscope he observed that bacteria had degenerated into small granules that stained red with Giemsa stain He concluded that "it the agent of transformation might almost be considered as an acute infectious disease of micrococci"
In   Allan Watt Downie showed that the smallpox vaccines being used in the th century and cowpox virus were not the same but were immunologically related
In March  a yearold Indiana boy and his mother contracted a lifethreatening vaccinia infection from the boys father The boy developed the telltale rash over  percent of his body after coming into close contact with his father who was vaccinated for smallpox before being deployed overseas by the United States Army The United States military resumed smallpox vaccinations in  The child acquired the infection due to eczema which is a known risk factor for vaccinia infection The boy was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin cidofovir and Tecovirimat ST a then experimental drug developed by SIGA Technologies On April   he was sent home with no after effects except for possible scarring of the skin
In  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC reported that a woman in Washington had contracted vaccinia virus infection after digital vaginal contact with her boyfriend a military member who had recently been vaccinated for smallpox The woman had a history of childhood eczema but she had not been symptomatic as an adult The CDC indicated that it was aware of four similar cases in the preceding  months of vaccinia infection after sexual contact with a recent military vaccinee Further casesalso in patients with a history of eczemaoccurred in 
This is a list of some of the wellcharacterized vaccinia strains used for research and vaccinationcitation needed
