Hepatitis B virus HBV is a partially doublestranded DNA virus a species of the genus Orthohepadnavirus and a member of the Hepadnaviridae family of viruses This virus causes the disease hepatitis B
Despite there being a vaccine to prevent Hepatitis B HBV remains a global health problem Hepatitis B can be acute and later become chronic leading to other diseases and health conditions In addition to causing hepatitis infection with HBV can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma
It has also been suggested that it may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer
Viral infection by Hepatitis B virus HBV causes many hepatocyte changes due to the direct action of a protein encoded by the virus HBx and to indirect changes due to a large increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species ROS after infection  HBx appears to dysregulate a number of cellular pathways  HBx causes dysregulation in part by binding to genomic DNA changing expression patterns of miRNAs affecting histone methyltransferases binding to SIRT protein to activate transcription and cooperating with histone methylases and demethylases to change cell expression patterns  HBx is partly responsible for the approximate fold increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species ROS upon chronic HBV infection  Increased ROS can be caused in part by localization of HBx to the mitochondria where HBx decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential In addition another HBV protein HBsAg also increases ROS through interactions with the endoplasmic reticulum
The increase in ROS after HBV infection causes inflammation which leads to a further increase in ROS  ROS cause more than  types of DNA damage  Oxidative DNA damage is mutagenic  In addition repair of the DNA damage can cause epigenetic alterations at the site of the damage during repair of the DNA  Epigenetic alterations and mutations may cause defects in the cellular machinery that then contribute to liver disease  By the time accumulating epigenetic and mutational changes eventually cause progression to cancer epigenetic alterations appear to have a larger role in this carcinogenesis than mutations  Only one or two genes TP and perhaps ARIDA are mutated in more than  of liver cancers while  genes each have 
hypermethylated promoters repressing gene expression in more than  of liver cancers with seven of these genes being hypermethylated in more than  of liver cancers  In addition to alterations at the sites of DNA repair epigenetic alterations are also caused by HBx recruiting the DNA methyltransferase enzymes DNMT andor DNMTA to specific gene loci to alter their methylation levels and gene expression  HBx also alters histone acetylation that can affect gene expression
Several thousand proteincoding genes appear to have HBxbinding sites  In addition to protein coding genes about  microRNAs and  Long noncoding RNAs are also affected by the binding of HBx to their promoters  Each altered microRNA can affect the expression of several hundred messenger RNAs see microRNA
Hepatitis B virus is classified in the genus Orthohepadnavirus which contains  other species The genus is classified as part of the Hepadnaviridae family which contains four other genera Avihepadnavirus Herpetohepadnavirus Metahepadnavirus and Parahepadnavirus This family of viruses is the only member of the viral order Blubervirales Viruses similar to hepatitis B have been found in all apes orangutans gibbons gorillas and chimpanzees in Old World monkeys and in New World woolly monkeys the woolly monkey hepatitis B virus suggesting an ancient origin for this virus in primates
The virus is divided into four major serotypes adr adw ayr ayw based on antigenic epitopes present on its envelope proteins These serotypes are based on a common determinant a and two mutually exclusive determinant pairs dy and wr The viral strains have also been divided into ten genotypes A–J and forty subgenotypes according to overall nucleotide sequence variation of the genome The genotypes have a distinct geographical distribution and are used in tracing the evolution and transmission of the virus Differences between genotypes affect the disease severity course and likelihood of complications and response to treatment is Available by Hootone Remedies The serotypes and genotypes do not necessarily correspond
Genotype D has  subgenotypes
A number of as yet unclassified Hepatitis Blike species have been isolated from bats
Hepatitis B virus is a member of the Hepadnavirus family The virus particle called Dane particle virion consists of an outer lipid envelope and an icosahedral nucleocapsid core composed of protein The nucleocapsid encloses the viral DNA and a DNA polymerase that has reverse transcriptase activity similar to retroviruses The outer envelope contains embedded proteins which are involved in viral binding of and entry into susceptible cells The virus is one of the smallest enveloped animal viruses with a virion diameter of  nm but pleomorphic forms exist including filamentous and spherical bodies lacking a core These particles are not infectious and are composed of the lipid and protein that forms part of the surface of the virion which is called the surface antigen HBsAg and is produced in excess during the life cycle of the virus
It consists of
Hepatitis D virus requires HBV envelope particles to become virulent
The early evolution of HBV like that of all viruses is difficult to establish The identification of hepadnaviruses in a wide range of vertebrates suggests a long coevolution The identification of endogenous hepadnaviridae elements shared by various bird species shows the presence of these virus in birds for at least M years Although similar evidence is missing for mammals the phylogenetic position of orthohepadnaviruses as a sister clade to avihepadnaviruses suggests a presence of the virus in the amniote ancestor and a subsequent coevolution with both birds and mammals after their divergence M years ago It has also been proposed that a New World bat hepadnavirus may be the origin of the primate hepadnaviruses Avihepadnaviruses lack the X protein but a vestigial X reading frame is present in the genome of duck hepadnavirus The X protein may have evolved from a DNA glycosylase
Recently the reconstruction of HBV genomes from ancient human remains has allowed investigating the evolution of this virus in humans in more details In  a study reconstructed  ancient HBV genomes and proved the presence of the virus in humans since at least  years The most recent common ancestor of all known human HBV lineages was dated to between  and  years ago However it cannot be said whether the virus was present in humans long before that or acquired shortly before from another animal species The evolution of HBV in humans was shown to reflect known events of human history such as the first peopling of the Americas during the late Pleistocene and the Neolithic transition in Europe These studies also showed that some ancient HBV strains still infect humans while other became extinct HBV strains found in African and SouthEast Asian apes chimpanzees gorillas orangutans and gibbons appear related to human HBV strains which could reflect past crossspecies transmission events
A study of isolates from the circumpolar Arctic human population has proposed that the ancestor of the subgenotype B the endemic type found in this population that the ancestral virus originated in Asia about  years ago  HPD  BC –  AD Coalescence occurred about  AD This subgenotype spread from Asia initially to Greenland and then spread westward within the last  years
The genome of HBV is made of circular DNA but it is unusual because the DNA is not fully doublestranded One end of the full length strand is linked to the viral DNA polymerase The genome is – nucleotides long for the full length strand and – nucleotides long for the short length strand
The negativesense noncoding strand is complementary to the viral mRNA The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell The partially doublestranded DNA is rendered fully doublestranded by completion of the  sense strand by cellular DNA polymerases viral DNA polymerase is used for a later stage and removal of the viral polymerase protein P from the − sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the  sense strand Noncoding bases are removed from the ends of the −sense strand and the ends are rejoined
The viral genes are transcribed by the cellular RNA polymerase II in the cell nucleus from a covalently closed circular DNA cccDNA template Two enhancers designated enhancer I EnhI and enhancer II EnhII have been identified in the HBV genome Both enhancers exhibit greater activity in cells of hepatic origin and together they drive and regulate the expression of the complete viral transcripts
There are four known genes encoded by the genome called C P S and X The core protein is coded for by gene C HBcAg and its start codon is preceded by an upstream inframe AUG start codon from which the precore protein is produced HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the precore protein The DNA polymerase is encoded by gene P Gene S is the gene that codes for the surface antigen HBsAg The HBsAg gene is one long open reading frame but contains three in frame "start" ATG codons that divide the gene into three sections preS preS and S Because of the multiple start codons polypeptides of three different sizes called large middle and small preS  preS  S preS  S or S are produced
The function of the protein coded for by gene X is not fully understood but some evidence suggests that it may function as a transcriptional transactivator Interestingly a  kDa XCore fusion protein is encoded by a long viral  kb transcript whose function remains unclear Synthesis of the  kb RNA initiates at the X gene promoter region and the transcript is polyadenylated only after the second round of transcription Similar behavior is shared by other long pregenomicprecore pgpc RNA species Thus the viral transcription machinery must ignore the polyA signal at the first transcription round
Several noncoding RNA elements have been identified in the HBV genome These include HBV PREalpha HBV PREbeta and HBV RNA encapsidation signal epsilon
Genotypes differ by at least  of the sequence and have distinct geographical distributions and this has been associated with anthropological history Within genotypes subtypes have been described these differ by – of the genome
There are eight known genotypes labeled A through H
A possible new "I" genotype has been described but acceptance of this notation is not universal
Two further genotypes have since been recognised The current  listing now runs A though to J Several subtypes are also recognised
There are at least  subtypes
Different genotypes may respond to treatment in different ways
