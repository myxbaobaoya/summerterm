Footandmouth disease virus FMDV is the pathogen that causes footandmouth disease  It is a picornavirus the prototypical member of the genus Aphthovirus  The disease which causes vesicles blisters in the mouth and feet of cattle pigs sheep goats and other clovenhoofed animals is highly infectious and a major plague of animal farming
The virus particle Â nm has an icosahedral capsid made of protein without envelope containing a positivesense mRNA sense singlestranded ribonucleic acid RNA genome
When the virus comes in contact with the membrane of a host cell it binds to a receptor site and triggers a foldingin of the membrane  Once the virus is inside the host cell the capsid dissolves and the RNA gets replicated and translated into viral proteins by the cells ribosomes using a capindependent mechanism driven by the internal ribosome entry site element
The synthesis of viral proteins include A cleavage during translation  They include proteases that inhibit the synthesis of normal cell proteins and other proteins that interact with different components of the host cell  The infected cell ends up producing large quantities of viral RNA and capsid proteins which are assembled to form new viruses  After assembly the host cell lyses bursts and releases the new viruses
Recombination can occur within host cells during coinfections by different FMDV strains 
Recombination is common and a key feature of FMDV evolution
Footandmouth disease virus occurs in seven major serotypes O A C SAT SAT SAT and Asia These serotypes show some regionality and the O serotype is most common
