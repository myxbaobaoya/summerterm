Ross River virus  RRV is a small encapsulated singlestrand RNA Alphavirus endemic to Australia Papua New Guinea and other islands in the South Pacific It is responsible for a type of mosquitoborne nonlethal but extremely debilitating tropical disease known as Ross River fever previously termed "epidemic polyarthritis" There is no known cure and it can last in the system of the host for up to  years The virus is suspected to be enzootic in populations of various native Australian mammals and has been found on occasion in horses
Taxonomically Ross River virus belongs to the virus genus Alphavirus which is part of the family Togaviridae The alphaviruses are a group of small enveloped singlestrand positivesense RNA viruses RRV belongs to a subgroup of "Old World" EurasianAfricanAustralasian alphaviruses and is considered closely related to Sagiyama virus
The virions virus particles themselves contain their genome in a protein capsid  Å in diameter They are characterised by the presence of two glycoproteins E and E embedded as trimeric dimers in a hostderived lipid envelope
Because RRV is transmitted by mosquitos it is considered an arbovirus a nontaxonomic term for viruses borne by arthropod vectors
In  an outbreak of acute febrile arthritis was recorded in Narrandera and Hay in New South Wales Australia In  several outbreaks of arthralgia and arthritis were described in the Northern Territory Queensland and the Schouten Islands off the northern coast of Papua New Guinea The name "epidemic polyarthritis" was coined for the disease In  an epidemic occurred in the Murray Valley which was compared to "acute viral polyarthritis" caused by Chikungunya virus The Australian disease seemed to progress in milder fashion In  serological testing suggested an unknown new species of alphavirus group A arbovirus was the likely culprit
In July and August  and  a virus recovered from mosquitoes collected near Tokyo Japan and was dubbed Sagiyama virus For a time it was thought to be a separate species but is now considered conspecific with Ross River virus
In  a new alphavirus was identified in samples from a mosquito Aedes vigilax trapped in the Ross River located in  Townsville Queensland Australia Further serological testing showed that patients who had suffered "epidemic polyarthritis" in Queensland had antibodies to the virus The new virus was named Ross River virus and the disease Ross River fever
The virus itself was first isolated in  using suckling mice It was found that RRV isolated from human serum could kill mice However the serum containing the virus that was used had come from an Aboriginal boy from Edward River North Queensland The child had a fever and a rash but no arthritis making the link between RRV and Ross River fever less than concrete
The largestever outbreak of the virus was in – and occurred in the western Pacific The outbreak involved the islands of Fiji Samoa the Cook Islands and New Caledonia However RRV was later isolated in humans following a series of epidemic polyarthritis outbreaks in Fiji Samoa and the Cook Islands during  RRV was isolated in an Australian patient suffering from Ross River fever in 
In  Ross River virus was found to have made its way to the Aundh area in Pune India and spread to other parts of the city The RRV infection is characterised by inflammation and pain to multiple joints Hydration by sufficient fluid intake is recommended to ensure that the fever does not rise to very dangerous levels It is also recommended that a doctor be consulted immediately as regular paracetamol gives only temporary reprieve from the fevercitation needed
In rural and regional areas of Australia the continued prevalence of Ross River virus is thought to be supported by natural reservoirs such as large marsupial mammals Antibodies to Ross River virus have been found in a wide variety of placental and marsupial mammals and also in a few bird species It is not presently known what reservoir hosts support Ross River virus in metropolitan areas such as Brisbane
The southern saltmarsh mosquito Aedes camptorhynchus which is known to carry the Ross River virus was discovered in Napier New Zealand in  Due to an year program by the New Zealand Ministry of Health and later the Ministry of Agriculture  Fisheries the species was declared completely eradicated from New Zealand in July  As of September  there has never been a report of a case of Ross River virus acquired within New Zealand
Separate mosquito species may act as vector widespread across areas and seasonalgeographical locations In southern and northern regions the Aedes group A camptorhynchus and A vigilax are the main RRV carriers However inland the Culex annulirostris is the main carrier with Aedes mosquitoes becoming active during wet seasons
Due to the expansion and housing demand in the south west of Western Australia residential development is occurring closer to wetlands in spite of the fact that the ecosystem is known for mosquito breeding Particularly in the Peel region where living near water is desirable for aesthetic value Over the decade of June  –  the population increased by  residents averaging a rate of  per cent per annum In June  the Peel region accounted for approximately five per cent of the States population and predicted to account for around  per cent of Western Australias population by 
A study comparing the risk of contracting Ross River virus RRV and the distance of the dwellings from Muddy Lakes The reports showed within a one kilometre buffer zone there were approximately  mosquitos in traps per night with  of them being Ae camptorhynchus decreasing to approximately  mosquitos with  Ae camptorhynchus at the six kilometre buffer zone The study suggests that there is a significantly higher risk of contracting RRV when living closer to Muddy Lakes however there was a rise in the two kilometre buffer zone of  mosquitos with  Ae camptorhynchus 
A similar trend in the study same study conducted in the Peel region resulting in less mosquitoes the further away the buffer distance
In – Leschenault and CapelBusselton were affected by an outbreak of  cases of RRV disease Although this occurred around a decade ago the data analysed the total RRV cases per  persons for each m buffer zone This shows an elevated risk of contracting the disease if living in close proximity to the Leschenault Estuary within  km being the strongest disease risk gradient
Evidence shows that there is a strong correlation between contracting RRV when living in close proximity to wetlands in the south west of Western Australia However due to continuous growth and development of residential areas around these wetlands it is expected that problems with RRV disease will occur
There are several factors that can contribute to an individuals risk for Ross River virus in Australia These risks were trialed in a study conducted in tropical Australia which illustrate that factors such as camping light coloured clothing exposure to certain flora and fauna and specific protective mechanisms are able to increase or decrease the likelihood of contracting the virus By increasing the frequency of camping the individuals risk increases eightfold suggesting that an increased exposure to wildlife increases risk This is shown by the narrow  confidence interval of – within the study For example an individuals exposure to kangaroos wallabies and bromeliad plants also increased risk suggesting that they are reservoirs for infection breeding sites for mosquitoes and potential vectors of the virus Although these areas show a higher risk for the virus humans should still enjoy the wildlife but consider that preventive mechanisms as increasingly important while camping
Ross River virus can be easily prevented through small behavioural mechanisms which should be of high importance in tropical areas and during participation of outdoor activities Firstly insect repellent should be rigorously used as to prevent bites from insects that specifically include mosquitoes which are vectors that carry the disease A study in tropical Australia shows a very narrow  confidence interval of – for a decrease in Ross River virus risk as a result of increased use of insect repellent suggesting a strong correlation between the two Following burning citronella candles are based on the same principle that it repels insects that are vectors of the virus Burning such candles also show a strong correlation with decreased Ross River virus risk shown in the same study with a narrow  confidence interval of –  Secondly wearing light coloured clothing decrease the risk of Ross River virus threefold This is again based on the repelling of vectors such as mosquitoes through the use of bright colours  Lastly high risk areas should be minimised by mechanisms of prevention that are applied within households For example screens should be fitted to windows and doors to prevent entry of insects carrying the virus and potential breeding areas such as open water containers or water holding plants should be removed Therefore specific climatic environments should be assessed for high risk factors and the appropriate precautions should be taken in response
The study of RRV has been recently facilitated by a mouse model Inbred mice infected with RRV develop hindlimb arthritisarthralgia The disease in mice similar to humans is characterised by an inflammatory infiltrate including macrophages which are immunopathogenic and exacerbate disease Furthermore recent data indicate that the serum component C directly contributes to disease since mice deficient in the C protein do not suffer from severe disease following infection
Ross River virus can cause multiple symptoms in someone who is infected the most common being arthritis or joint pain Other symptoms include a rash on the limbs of the body which often occurs roughly  days after arthritis begins Lymph nodes may enlarge most commonly in the arm pits or groin region and rarely a feeling of pins and needles in the persons hands and feet but only occurs in a small number of people  The virus also causes moderate symptoms in horses
The symptoms of Ross River virus are important to recognise for early diagnosis and therefore early treatment Symptoms have been illustrated in a case report of an infected Thuringian traveller returning from SouthEast Australia This case showed flulike symptoms that include fever chills headache and pains in the body Additionally joint pain arose in which some joints become swollen and joint stiffness was particularly noticeable A clinical examination of the infected individual shows a significant decrease of specific antibodies despite the normal blood count levels A rash is a good indication that is likely to occur but usually disappears after ten days The symptoms of Ross River virus are important to be aware of so that early treatment can be administered before the virus worsens The time between catching the disease and experiencing symptoms is anywhere between three days to three weeks usually it takes about – weeks A person can be tested for Ross River virus by a blood test other illnesses may need to be excluded before diagnosis
Testing for Ross River virus should occur in patients who are experiencing acute polyarthritis tiredness andor rashes  with a history of travel within areas prone to infection from the virus Serology blood tests is the appropriate manner by which to diagnose Ross River virus Within  days of infection the virus produces Immunoglobulin M IgM and is a presumptive positive diagnosis IgM may persist for months or even years and therefore false positives may be triggered by Barmah Forest virus rubella Q fever or rheumatoid factor To completely test for Ross River virus a second serology test must be conducted – days after the first The patient may then be declared positive for Ross River virus infection if there is a fold increase of IgM antibody count
Ross River fever is also known as Ross River virus infection or Ross River virus disease Ross River virus is named after the Ross River in Townsville which is the place where it was first identified Ross River fever is the most common mosquitoborne disease in Australia and nearly  people are reported to be infected with the virus each year
