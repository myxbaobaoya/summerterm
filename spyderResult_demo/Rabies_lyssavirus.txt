Rabies virus scientific name Rabies lyssavirus is a neurotropic virus that causes rabies in humans and animals Rabies transmission can occur through the saliva of animals and less commonly through contact with human saliva Rabies lyssavirus like many rhabdoviruses has an extremely wide host range In the wild it has been found infecting many mammalian species while in the laboratory it has been found that birds can be infected as well as cell cultures from mammals birds reptiles and insects Rabies is reported in more than  countries on all continents with the exclusion of Antarctica The main burden of disease is reported in Asia and Africa but some cases have been reported also in Europe in the past  years especially in returning travellers
Rabies lyssavirus has a cylindrical morphology and is a member of the Lyssavirus genus of the Rhabdoviridae family These viruses are enveloped and have a single stranded RNA genome with negativesense The genetic information is packaged as a ribonucleoprotein complex in which RNA is tightly bound by the viral nucleoprotein The RNA genome of the virus encodes five genes whose order is highly conserved These genes code for nucleoprotein N phosphoprotein P matrix protein M glycoprotein G and the viral RNA polymerase L The complete genome sequences range from  to  nt in length
All transcription and replication events take place in the cytoplasm inside a specialized virus factory the Negri body named after Adelchi Negri  These are – µm in diameter and  are typical for a rabies infection and thus have been used as definite histological proof of such infection
Rhabdoviruses have helical symmetry so their infectious particles are approximately cylindrical in shape They are characterized by an extremely broad host spectrum ranging from plants to insects and mammals humaninfecting viruses more commonly have icosahedral symmetry and take shapes approximating regular polyhedra
The rabies genome encodes five proteins nucleoprotein N phosphoprotein P matrix protein M glycoprotein G and polymerase L All rhabdoviruses have two major structural components a helical ribonucleoprotein core RNP and a surrounding envelope In the RNP genomic RNA is tightly encased by the nucleoprotein Two other viral proteins the phosphoprotein and the large protein Lprotein or polymerase are associated with the RNP The glycoprotein forms approximately  trimeric spikes which are tightly arranged on the surface of the virus The M protein is associated both with the envelope and the RNP and may be the central protein of rhabdovirus assembly
Rabies lyssavirus has a bulletlike shape with a length of about  nm and a crosssectional diameter of about  nm One end is rounded or conical and the other end is planar or concave The lipoprotein envelope carries knoblike spikes composed of Glycoprotein G Spikes do not cover the planar end of the virion virus particle Beneath the envelope is the membrane or matrix M protein layer which may be invaginated at the planar end The core of the virion consists of helically arranged ribonucleoprotein
The rhabdovirus virion is an enveloped rod or bulletshaped structure containing five protein species The nucleoprotein N coats the RNA at the rate of one monomer of protein to nine nucleotides forming a nucleocapsid with helical symmetry Associated with the nucleocapsid are copies of P phosphoprotein and L large protein The L protein is well named its gene taking up about half of the genome Its large size is justified by the fact that it is a multifunctional protein The M matrix protein forms a layer between the nucleocapsid and the envelope and trimers of G glycoprotein form spikes that protrude from the envelope The genomes of all rhabdoviruses encode these five proteins and in the case of Rabies Lyssavirus they are all of them
After receptor binding Rabies lyssavirus enters its host cells through the endosomal transport pathway Inside the endosome the low pH value induces the membrane fusion process thus enabling the viral genome to reach the cytosol  Both processes receptor binding and membrane fusion are catalyzed by the glycoprotein G which plays a critical role in pathogenesis mutant virus without G proteins cannot propagate
The next step after its entry is the transcription of the viral genome by the PL polymerase P is an essential cofactor for the L polymerase in order to make new viral protein The viral polymerase can only recognize ribonucleoprotein and cannot use free RNA as template Transcription is regulated by cisacting sequences on the virus genome and by protein M which is not only essential for virus budding but also regulates the fraction of mRNA production to replication Later in infection the activity of the polymerase switches to replication in order to produce fulllength positivestrand RNA copies These complementary RNAs are used as templates to make new negativestrand RNA genomes They are packaged together with protein N to form ribonucleoprotein which then can form new viruses
In September  Joseph Lennox Pawan of Trinidad found Negri bodies in the brain of a bat with unusual habits In  Pawan first discovered that infected vampire bats could transmit rabies to humans and other animals
From the wound of entry Rabies lyssavirus travels quickly along the neural pathways of the peripheral nervous system The retrograde axonal transport of Rabies lyssavirus to the central nervous system CNS is the key step of pathogenesis during natural infection The exact molecular mechanism of this transport is unknown although binding of the P protein from Rabies lyssavirus to the dynein light chain protein DYNLL has been shown P also acts as an interferon antagonist thus decreasing the immune response of the host
From the CNS the virus further spreads to other organs The salivary glands located in the tissues of the mouth and cheeks receive high concentrations of the virus thus allowing it to be further transmitted due to projectile salivation Fatality can occur from two days to five years from the time of initial infection This however depends largely on the species of animal acting as a reservoir Most infected mammals die within weeks while strains of a species such as the African yellow mongoose Cynictis penicillata might survive an infection asymptomatically for years
The first symptoms of rabies may be very similar to those of the flu including general weakness or discomfort fever or headache These symptoms may last for days There may be also discomfort or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of bite progressing within days to symptoms of cerebral dysfunction anxiety confusion agitation As the disease progresses the person may experience delirium abnormal behavior hallucinations and insomnia Rabies lyssavirus may also be inactive in its hosts body and become active after a long period of time
Upon viral entry into the body and also after vaccination the body produces virus neutralizing antibodies which bind and inactivate the virus Specific regions of the G protein have been shown to be most antigenic in leading to the production of virus neutralizing antibodies These antigenic sites or epitopes are categorized into regions I–IV and minor site a Previous work has demonstrated that antigenic sites II and III are most commonly targeted by natural neutralizing antibodies Additionally a monoclonal antibody with neutralizing functionality has been demonstrated to target antigenic site I Other proteins such as the nucleoprotein have been shown to be unable to elicit production of virus neutralizing antibodies The epitopes which bind neutralizing antibodies are both linear and conformational
All extant rabies viruses appear to have evolved within the last  years There are seven genotypes of Rabies lyssavirus In Eurasia cases are due to three of thesegenotype  classical rabies and to a lesser extent genotypes  and  European bat lyssaviruses type and  Genotype  evolved in Europe in the th century and spread to Asia Africa and the Americas as a result of European exploration and colonization
Bat rabies in North America appears to have been present since  CE  confidence interval – CE
The rabies virus appears to have undergone an evolutionary shift in hosts from Chiroptera bats to a species of Carnivora ie raccoon or skunk as a result of an homologous recombination event that occurred hundreds of years ago  This recombination event altered the gene that encodes the virus glycoprotein that is necessary for receptor recognition and binding
Rabies lyssavirus is used in research for viral neuronal tracing to establish synaptic connections and directionality of synaptic transmission
