Hepatitis C virusHCVhuman hepatitis C virus
The hepatitis C virus HCV is a small – nm in size enveloped positivesense singlestranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae The hepatitis C virus is the cause of hepatitis C and some cancers such as liver cancer hepatocellular carcinoma abbreviated HCC and lymphomas in humans
The hepatitis C virus belongs to the genus Hepacivirus a member of the family Flaviviridae Before  it was considered to be the only member of this genus However a member of this genus has been discovered in dogs canine hepacivirus There is also at least one virus in this genus that infects horses Several additional viruses in the genus have been described in bats and rodents
The hepatitis C virus particle consists of a lipid membrane envelope that is  to  nm in diameter Two viral envelope glycoproteins E and E are embedded in the lipid envelope They take part in viral attachment and entry into the cell Within the envelope is an icosahedral core that is  to  nm in diameter Inside the core is the RNA material of the virus
E and E are covalently bonded when embedded in the envelope of HCV and are stabilized by disulfide bonds E is globular and seems to protrude  nm out from the envelope membrane according to electron microscope images
These glycoproteins play an important role in the interactions hepatitis C has with the immune system A hypervariable region the hypervariable region  HVR can be found on the E glycoprotein HVR is flexible and quite accessible to surrounding molecules HVR helps E shield the virus from the immune system It prevents CD from latching onto its respective receptor on the virus In addition E can shield E from the immune system Although HVR is quite variable in amino acid sequence this region has similar chemical physical and conformational characteristics across many E glycoproteins
Hepatitis C virus has a positive sense singlestranded RNA genome The genome consists of a single open reading frame that is  nucleotide bases long This single open reading frame is translated to produce a single protein product which is then further processed to produce smaller active proteins This is why on publicly available databases such as the European Bioinformatics Institute the viral proteome only consists of  proteins
At the ′ and ′ ends of the RNA are the untranslated regions UTR that are not translated into proteins but are important to translation and replication of the viral RNA The ′ UTR has a ribosome binding site or internal ribosome entry site IRES that initiates the translation of a very long protein containing about  amino acids The core domain of the HCV IRES contains a fourway helical Holliday junction that is integrated within a predicted pseudoknot The conformation of this core domain constrains the open reading frames orientation for positioning on the S ribosomal subunit The large preprotein is later cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into the  smaller proteins that allow viral replication within the host cell or assemble into the mature viral particles Structural proteins made by the hepatitis C virus include Core protein E and E nonstructural proteins include NS NS NSA NSB NSA and NSBcitation needed
The proteins of this virus are arranged along the genome in the following order N terminalcoreenvelope E–E–pnonstructural protein  NS–NS–NSA–NSB–NSA–NSB–C terminal The mature nonstructural proteins NS to NSB generation relies on the activity of viral proteinases The NSNS junction is cleaved by a metaldependent autocatalytic proteinase encoded within NS and the Nterminus of NS The remaining cleavages downstream from this site are catalysed by a serine protease also contained within the Nterminal region of NS
An th protein has also been described This protein is encoded by a  frameshift in the capsid gene It appears to be antigenic but its function is unknown
Replication of HCV involves several steps The virus replicates mainly in the hepatocytes of the liver where it is estimated that daily each infected cell produces approximately fifty virions virus particles with a calculated total of one trillion virions generated  The virus may also replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells potentially accounting for the high levels of immunological disorders found in chronically infected HCV patients In the liver the HCV particles are brought into the hepatic sinusoids by blood flow These sinusoids neighbor hepatocyte cells HCV is able to pass through the endothelium of the sinusoids and make its way to the basolateral surface of the hepatocyte cells
HCV has a wide variety of genotypes and mutates rapidly due to a high error rate on the part of the virus RNAdependent RNA polymerase The mutation rate produces so many variants of the virus it is considered a quasispecies rather than a conventional virus species  Entry into host cells occur through complex interactions between virions especially through their glycoproteins and cellsurface molecules CD LDL receptor SRBI DCSIGN Claudin and Occludin
The envelope of HCV is similar to very lowdensity lipoproteins VLDL and lowdensity lipoproteins LDL Because of this similarity the virus is thought to be able to associate with apolipoproteins It could surround itself with lipoproteins partially covering up E and E Recent research indicates that these apolipoproteins interact with scavenger receptor B SRB SRB is able to remove lipids from the lipoproteins around the virus to better allow for HVR contact Claudin  which is a tightjunction protein and CD link to create a complex priming them for later HCV infection processes As the immune system is triggered macrophages increase the amount of TNFα around the hepatocytes which are being infected This triggers the migration of occludin which is another tightjunction complex to the basolateral membrane The HCV particle is ready to enter the cell
These interactions lead to the endocytosis of the viral particle This process is aided by clathrin proteins Once inside an early endosome the endosome and the viral envelope fuse and the RNA is allowed into the cytoplasm
HCV takes over portions of the intracellular machinery to replicate The HCV genome is translated to produce a single protein of around  amino acids The polyprotein is then proteolytically processed by viral and cellular proteases to produce three structural virionassociated and seven nonstructural NS proteins Alternatively a frameshift may occur in the Core region to produce an alternate reading frame protein ARFP HCV encodes two proteases the NS cysteine autoprotease and the NSA serine protease The NS proteins then recruit the viral genome into an RNA replication complex which is associated with rearranged cytoplasmic membranes RNA replication takes place via the viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase NSB which produces a negative strand RNA intermediate The negative strand RNA then serves as a template for the production of new positive strand viral genomes Nascent genomes can then be translated further replicated or packaged within new virus particles
The virus replicates on intracellular lipid membranes The endoplasmic reticulum in particular is deformed into uniquely shaped membrane structures termed membranous webs These structures can be induced by sole expression of the viral protein NSB The core protein associates with lipid droplets and utilises microtubules and dyneins to alter their location to a perinuclear distribution Release from the hepatocyte may involve the VLDL secretory pathway Another hypothesis states that the viral particle may be secreted from the endoplasmic reticulum through the endosomal sorting complex required for transport ESCRT pathway This pathway is normally utilized to bud vesicles out of the cell The only limitation to this hypothesis is that the pathway is normally used for cellular budding and it is not known how HCV would commandeer the ESCRT pathway for use with the endoplasmic reticulum
Based on genetic differences between HCV isolates the hepatitis C virus species is classified into six genotypes – with several subtypes within each genotype represented by lowercase letters Subtypes are further broken down into quasispecies based on their genetic diversity Genotypes differ by – of the nucleotide sites over the complete genome The difference in genomic composition of subtypes of a genotype is usually – Subtypes a and b are found worldwide and cause  of all cases
Genotype is clinically important in determining potential response to interferonbased therapy and the required duration of such therapy Genotypes  and  are less responsive to interferonbased treatment than are the other genotypes    and  The duration of standard interferonbased therapy for genotypes  and  is  weeks whereas treatment for genotypes  and  is completed in  weeks Sustained virological responses occur in  of genotype  cases  of genotypes  and   of genotype  and  of genotype  In addition people of African descent are much less likely to respond to treatment when infected with genotypes  or  The substantial proportion of this lack of response to treatment is proposed to be caused by a singlenucleotide polymorphism SNP on chromosome  of the human genome that is predictive of treatment success HCV genotypes  and  have been distributed endemically in overlapping areas of West and Central Africa infecting for centuries human populations carrying the genetic polymorphism in question This has prompted scientists to suggest that the protracted persistence of HCV genotypes  and  in people of African origin is an evolutionary adaptation of HCV over many centuries to these populations immunogenetic responses
Infection with one genotype does not confer immunity against others and concurrent infection with two strains is possible In most of these cases one of the strains outcompetes the other in a short time This finding may be useful in treatment in replacing strains nonresponsive to medication with others easier to treat
When two viruses infect the same cell genetic recombination may occur  Although infrequent HCV recombination has been observed between different genotypes between subtypes of the same genotype and even between strains of the same subtype
Hepatitis C virus is predominantly a bloodborne virus with very low risk of sexual or vertical transmission Because of this mode of spread the key groups at risk are intravenous drug users IDUs recipients of blood products and sometimes patients on haemodialysis Common setting for transmission of HCV is also intrahospital nosocomial transmission when practices of hygiene and sterilization are not correctly followed in the clinic A number of cultural or ritual practices have been proposed as a potential historical mode of spread for HCV including circumcision genital mutilation ritual scarification traditional tattooing and acupuncture It has also been argued that given the extremely prolonged periods of persistence of HCV in humans even very low and undetectable rates of mechanical transmission via biting insects may be sufficient to maintain endemic infection in the tropics where people receive large number of insect bites
Identification of the origin of this virus has been difficult but genotypes  and  appear to share a common origin 
A Bayesian analysis suggests that the major genotypes diverged about – years ago from the common ancestor virus The minor genotypes diverged about  years ago from their major genotypes All of the extant genotypes appear to have evolved from genotype  subtype b
A study of genotype  strains suggests an earlier date of evolution approximately  to  years Before Present The estimated rate of mutation was  × − An experimental study estimated the mutation rate at  – × − base substitutions per site per year This genotype may be the ancestor of the other genotypes
A study of European US and Japanese isolates suggested that the date of origin of genotype b was approximately in the year  The estimated dates of origin of types a and a were  and  respectively The time of divergence of types a and b was estimated to be – years
A study of genotype a and b estimated the dates of origin to be – for type a and – for type b Both types a and b underwent massive expansions in their effective population size between  and  The expansion of HCV subtype b preceded that of subtype a by at least  years Both types appear to have spread from the developed world to the developing world
The genotype  strains from Africa can be divided into four clades that correlate with their country of origin  Cameroon and Central African Republic  Benin Ghana and Burkina Faso  Gambia Guinea GuineaBissau and Senegal  Madagascar
There is also strong evidence for the dissemination of HCV genotype  from West Africa to the Caribbean by the transAtlantic slave trade
Genotype  is thought to have its origin in South East Asia
These dates from these various countries suggests that this virus may have evolved in South East Asia and was spread to West Africa by traders from Western Europe It was later introduced into Japan once that countrys selfimposed isolation was lifted Once introduced to a country its spread has been influenced by many local factors including blood transfusions vaccination programmes intravenous drug use and treatment regimes Given the reduction in the rate of spread once screening for HCV in blood products was implemented in the s it would seem that previously blood transfusion was an important method of spread Additional work is required to determine the dates of evolution of the various genotypes and the timing of their spread across the globecitation needed
Unlike hepatitis A and B there is currently no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C infection
The study of HCV has been hampered by the narrow host range of HCV  The use of replicons has been successful but these have only been recently discovered  HCV as with most RNA viruses exists as a viral quasispecies making it very difficult to isolate a single strain or receptor type for study
Current research is focused on smallmolecule inhibitors of the viral protease RNA polymerase and other nonstructural genes Two agentsboceprevir by Merck and telaprevir by Vertex Pharmaceuticalsboth inhibitors of NS protease were approved for use on May   and May   respectively
A possible association between low Vitamin D levels and a poor response to treatment has been reported In vitro work has shown that vitamin D may be able to reduce viral replication While this work looks promising the results of clinical trials are pending However it has been proposed that vitamin D supplementation is important in addition to standard treatment in order to enhance treatment response
Naringenin a flavonoid found in grapefruit and other fruits and herbs has been shown to block the assembly of intracellular infectious viral particles without affecting intracellular levels of the viral RNA or protein
Other agents that are under investigation include nucleoside and nucleotide analogue inhibitors and nonnucleoside inhibitors of the RNAdependent RNA polymerase inhibitors of NSPA and hosttargeted compounds such as cyclophilin inhibitors and silibinin
Sofosbuvir for use against chronic hepatitis C infection was approved by the FDA on December    It has been reported to be the first drug that has demonstrated safety and efficacy to treat certain types of HCV infection without the need for coadministration of interferon  On November  the FDA approved simeprevir for use in combination with peginterferonalfa and ribavirin  Simeprevir has been approved in Japan for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection genotype 
There is also current experimental research on non drug related therapies Oxymatrine for example is a root extract found in the continent of Asia that has been reported to have antiviral activity against HCV in cell cultures and animal studies Small and promising human trials have shown beneficial results and no serious side effects but they were too small to generalize conclusions
On October th  it was announced that Harvey J Alter Michael Houghton and Charles M Rice had been awarded the  Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of HCV
