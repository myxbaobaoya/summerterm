Eastern equine encephalitis EEE commonly called  Triple E or sleeping sickness not to be confused with African trypanosomiasis is a disease caused by a zoonotic mosquito vectored Togavirus that is present in North Central and South America and the Caribbean EEE was first recognized in Massachusetts United States in  when  horses died mysteriously of viral encephalitis
Epizootics in horses have continued to occur regularly in the United States It can also be identified in donkeys and zebras Due to the rarity of the disease its occurrence can cause economic impact beyond the cost of horses and poultry EEE is found today in the eastern part of the United States and is often associated with coastal plains It can most commonly be found in East Coast and Gulf Coast states In Florida about one to two human cases are reported a year although over  cases of equine encephalitis are reported In years in which conditions  are favorable for the disease the number of equine cases is over  Diagnosing equine encephalitis is challenging because many of the symptoms are shared with other illnesses and patients can be asymptomatic Confirmations may require a sample of cerebral spinal fluid or brain tissue although CT scans and MRI scans are used to detect encephalitis This could be an indication that the need to test for EEE is necessary If a biopsy of the cerebral spinal fluid is taken it is sent to a specialized laboratory for testing
Eastern equine encephalitis virus EEEV is closely related to Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and western equine encephalitis virus
The incubation period for Eastern equine encephalitis virus EEEV disease ranges from  to  days The illness can progress either systematically or encephalitically depending on the persons age Encephalitic disease involves swelling of the brain and can be asymptomatic while the systemic illness occurs very abruptly Those with the systemic illness usually recover within – weeks While the encephalitis is more common among infants in adults and children it usually manifests after experiencing the systemic illness Symptoms include high fever muscle pain altered mental status headache meningeal irritation photophobia and seizures which occur – days after the bite of an infected mosquito Due to the viruss effect on the brain patients who survive can be left with mental and physical impairments such as personality disorders paralysis seizures and intellectual impairment
The causative agent later identified as a togavirus was first isolated from infected horse brains in  In  the first confirmed human cases were identified when  children died of encephalitis in the Northeastern United States These cases coincided with outbreaks in horses in the same regions The fatality rate in humans is  and currently no cure is known for human infections This virus has four variations in the types in lineage The most common to the human disease is group  which is considered to be endemic in North America and the Caribbean while the other three lineages groups IIA IIB and III are typically found in Central and South America causing equine illness
These two clades may actually be distinct viruses The North American strains appear to be monotypic with a mutation rate of  × − substitutionssiteyear ssy It appears to have diverged from the other strains  to  years ago The other strains are divided into two main clades and a third smaller one The two main clades diverged between  and  years ago The mutation rate in the genome has been estimated to be  × − ssycitation needed
EEEV is capable of infecting a wide range of animals including mammals birds reptiles and amphibians The virus is maintained in nature through a birdmosquito cycle  Two mosquito species are primarily involved in this portion of the cycle they are Culiseta melanura and Culiseta morsitans Wikidata These mosquitoes feed on the blood of birds The frequency of the virus found in nature increases throughout the summer as more birds and more mosquitoes become infectedcitation needed
Transmission of EEEV to mammals including humans occurs via other mosquito species which feed on the blood of both birds and mammals These other mosquitoes are referred to as "bridge vectors" because they carry the virus from the avian hosts to other types of hosts particularly mammals The bridge vectors include Aedes taeniorhynchus Aedes vexans Coquillettidia perturbans Ochlerotatus canadensis and Ochlerotatus sollicitans Ochlerotatus canadensis also frequently bites turtles
Humans horses and most other infected mammals do not circulate enough viruses in their blood to infect additional mosquitoes Some cases of EEE have been contracted through laboratory exposures or from exposure of the eyes lungs or skin wounds to brain or spinal cord matter from infected animalscitation needed
The disease can be prevented in horses with the use of vaccinations which are usually given with vaccinations for other diseases most commonly western equine encephalitis virus Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and tetanus  Most vaccinations for EEE consist of the killed virus For humans no vaccine for EEE is available prevention involves reducing the risk of exposure Using insect repellent wearing protective clothing and reducing the amount of standing water is the best means for prevention
No cure for EEE has been found Treatment consists of corticosteroids anticonvulsants and supportive measures treating symptoms such as intravenous fluids tracheal intubation and antipyreticscitation needed About  of humans known to be infected develop symptoms with a total of about six cases per year in the US A third of these cases die and many survivors suffer permanent brain damage
Several states in the Northeast US have had increased virus activity since   Between  and  at least ten human cases of EEE were reported in Massachusetts  In  about  acres  km in southeastern Massachusetts were treated with mosquito adulticides to reduce the risk of humans contracting EEE  Several human cases were reported in New Hampshire as well
On  July  the virus was identified in a mosquito of the species Coquillettidia perturbans in Nickerson State Park on Cape Cod Massachusetts On  July  the virus was found in mosquitos in Pittsfield Massachusetts
As of September update a notable uptick in cases erupted in New England and Michigan prompting some health departments to declare an outbreak As of  October update five people died in Michigan three people died in Connecticut one person died in Rhode Island one person died in Alabama one person died in Indiana and three people died in Massachusetts The virus was also found in goats in turkeys in deer and in horses
As of September   there were  confirmed human cases between Massachusetts and Wisconsin As of October   one person died in Michigan and one person died in Wisconsin
In October  a citizen of Livingston West Lothian Scotland became the first European victim of this disease The man had visited New Hampshire during the summer of  on a fishing vacation and was diagnosed as having EEE on  September  He fell ill with the disease on  August  just one day after flying home and later fell into a coma He later awoke from the coma with severe brain injuries
EEEV was one of more than a dozen agents that the United States researched as potential biological weapons before the nation suspended its biologicalweapons program in  a few years before signing  and then ratifying  the Biological Weapons Convention
After inoculation by the vector the virus travels via lymphatics to lymph nodes and replicates in macrophages and neutrophils resulting in lymphopenia leukopenia and fever Subsequent replication occurs in other organs leading to viremia Symptoms in horses occur – weeks after infection and begin with a fever that may reach as high as  °F  °C The fever usually lasts for – hoursmedical citation needed
Nervous signs appear during the fever that include sensitivity to sound periods of excitement and restlessness  Brain lesions appear causing drowsiness drooping ears circling aimless wandering head pressing inability to swallow and abnormal gait  Paralysis follows causing the horse to have difficulty raising its head The horse usually suffers complete paralysis and death – days after symptoms appear  Mortality rates among horses with the eastern strain range from  to medical citation needed
