Influenza A virus IAV causes influenza in birds and some mammals and is the only species of the genus Alphainfluenzavirus of the virus family Orthomyxoviridae Strains of all subtypes of influenza A virus have been isolated from wild birds although disease is uncommon Some isolates of influenza A virus cause severe disease both in domestic poultry and rarely in humans Occasionally viruses are transmitted from wild aquatic birds to domestic poultry and this may cause an outbreak or give rise to human influenza pandemics
Influenza A viruses are negativesense singlestranded segmented RNA viruses The several subtypes are labeled according to an H number for the type of hemagglutinin and an N number for the type of neuraminidase There are  different known H antigens H to H and  different known N antigens N to N HN was isolated from fruit bats in  HN was discovered in a Peruvian bat in 
Each virus subtype has mutated into a variety of strains with differing pathogenic profiles some are pathogenic to one species but not others some are pathogenic to multiple species
A filtered and purified influenza A vaccine for humans has been developed and many countries have stockpiled it to allow a quick administration to the population in the event of an avian influenza pandemic Avian influenza is sometimes called avian flu and colloquially bird flu In  researchers reported the discovery of an antibody effective against all types of the influenza A virus
Influenza type A viruses are RNA viruses categorized into subtypes based on the type of two proteins on the surface of the viral envelope
The hemagglutinin is central to the viruss recognizing and binding to target cells and also to its then infecting the cell with its RNA The neuraminidase on the other hand is critical for the subsequent release of the daughter virus particles created within the infected cell so they can spread to other cells
Different influenza viruses encode for different hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins For example the HN virus designates an influenza A subtype that has a type  hemagglutinin H protein and a type  neuraminidase N protein There are  known types of hemagglutinin and  known types of neuraminidase so in theory  different combinations of these proteins are possible
Some variants are identified and named according to the isolate they resemble thus are presumed to share lineage example Fujian flu viruslike according to their typical host example human flu virus according to their subtype example HN and according to their deadliness example LP low pathogenic So a flu from a virus similar to the isolate AFujianHN is called Fujian flu human flu and HN flu
Variants are sometimes named according to the species host in which the strain is endemic or to which it is adapted The main variants named using this convention are
Variants have also sometimes been named according to their deadliness in poultry especially chickens
Most known strains are extinct strains For example the annual flu subtype HN no longer contains the strain that caused the Hong Kong flu
The annual flu also called "seasonal flu" or "human flu" in the US "results in approximately  deaths and more than  hospitalizations each year In addition to this human toll influenza is annually responsible for a total cost of over  billion in the US" Globally the toll of influenza virus is estimated at – deaths annually exceeding previous estimates
The annually updated trivalent influenza vaccine consists of hemagglutinin HA surface glycoprotein components from influenza HN HN and B influenza viruses
Measured resistance to the standard antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine in HN has increased from  in  to  in  to  in 
"Contemporary human HN influenza viruses are now endemic in pigs in southern China and can reassort with avian HN viruses in this intermediate host"
FI an antibody that targets the hemagglutinin protein was discovered in  FI is the only known antibody effective against all  subtypes of the influenza A virus
Influenza type A viruses are very similar in structure to influenza viruses types B C and D The virus particle also called the virion is – nanometers in diameter such that the smallest virions adopt an elliptical shape The length of each particle varies considerably owing to the fact that influenza is pleomorphic and can be in excess of many tens of micrometers producing filamentous virions Confusion about the nature of influenza virus pleomorphy stems from the observation that lab adapted strains typically lose the ability to form filaments and that these lab adapted strains were the first to be visualized by electron microscopy Despite these varied shapes the virions of all influenza type A viruses are similar in composition They are all made up of a viral envelope containing two main types of proteins wrapped around a central core
The two large proteins found on the outside of viral particles are hemagglutinin HA and neuraminidase NA HA is a protein that mediates binding of the virion to target cells and entry of the viral genome into the target cell NA is involved in release from the abundant nonproductive attachment sites present in mucus as well as the release of progeny virions from infected cells These proteins are usually the targets for antiviral drugs Furthermore they are also the antigen proteins to which a hosts antibodies can bind and trigger an immune response Influenza type A viruses are categorized into subtypes based on the type of these two proteins on the surface of the viral envelope There are  subtypes of HA and  subtypes of NA known but only H   and  and N  and  are commonly found in humans
The central core of a virion contains the viral genome and other viral proteins that package and protect the genetic material Unlike the genomes of most organisms including humans animals plants and bacteria which are made up of doublestranded DNA many viral genomes are made up of a different singlestranded nucleic acid called RNA Unusually for a virus though the influenza type A virus genome is not a single piece of RNA instead it consists of segmented pieces of negativesense RNA each piece containing either one or two genes which code for a gene product protein The term negativesense RNA just implies that the RNA genome cannot be translated into protein directly it must first be transcribed to positivesense RNA before it can be translated into protein products The segmented nature of the genome allows for the exchange of entire genes between different viral strains
The entire Influenza A virus genome is  bases long and is contained on eight RNA segments that code for at least  but up to  proteins depending on the strain The relevance or presence of alternate gene products can vary
The RNA segments of the viral genome have complementary base sequences at the terminal ends allowing them to bond to each other with hydrogen bonds Transcription of the viral  sense genome vRNA can only proceed after the PB protein binds to host capped RNAs allowing for the PA subunit to cleave several nucleotides after the cap This hostderived cap and accompanied nucleotides serve as the primer for viral transcription initiation Transcription proceeds along the vRNA until a stretch of several uracil bases is reached initiating a stuttering whereby the nascent viral mRNA is polyadenylated producing a mature transcript for nuclear export and translation by host machinery
The RNA synthesis takes place in the cell nucleus while the synthesis of proteins takes place in the cytoplasm Once the viral proteins are assembled into virions the assembled virions leave the nucleus and migrate towards the cell membrane The host cell membrane has patches of viral transmembrane proteins HA NA and M and an underlying layer of the M protein which assist the assembled virions to budding through the membrane releasing finished enveloped viruses into the extracellular fluid
The subtypes of influenza A virus are estimated to have diverged  years ago Influenza viruses A and B are estimated to have diverged from a single ancestor around  years ago while the ancestor of influenza viruses A and B and the ancestor of influenza virus C are estimated to have diverged from a common ancestor around  years ago
Influenza virus is able to undergo multiplicity reactivation after inactivation by UV radiation or by ionizing radiation If any of the eight RNA strands that make up the genome contains damage that prevents replication or expression of an essential gene the virus is not viable when it alone infects a cell a single infection  However when two or more damaged viruses infect the same cell multiple infection viable progeny viruses can be produced provided each of the eight genomic segments is present in at least one undamaged copy  That is multiplicity reactivation can occur
Upon infection influenza virus induces a host response involving increased production of reactive oxygen species and this can damage the virus genome If under natural conditions virus survival is ordinarily vulnerable to the challenge of oxidative damage then multiplicity reactivation is likely selectively advantageous as a kind of genomic repair process  It has been suggested that multiplicity reactivation involving segmented RNA genomes may be similar to the earliest evolved form of sexual interaction in the RNA world that likely preceded the DNA world Also see RNA world hypothesis
"Human influenza virus" usually refers to those subtypes that spread widely among humans HN HN and HN are the only known influenza A virus subtypes currently circulating among humans
Genetic factors in distinguishing between "human flu viruses" and "avian influenza viruses" include
Human flu symptoms usually include fever cough sore throat muscle aches conjunctivitis and in severe cases breathing problems and pneumonia that may be fatal The severity of the infection will depend in large part on the state of the infected persons immune system and if the victim has been exposed to the strain before and is therefore partially immune Followup studies on the impact of statins on influenza virus replication show that pretreatment of cells with atorvastatin suppresses virus growth in culture
Highly pathogenic HN avian influenza in a human is far worse killing  of humans who catch it In one case a boy with HN experienced diarrhea followed rapidly by a coma without developing respiratory or flulike symptoms
The influenza A virus subtypes that have been confirmed in humans ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths are

HN
In May  in Zhenjiang China HN was reported for the first time in humans One person was infected
According to Jeffery Taubenberger
Researchers from the National Institutes of Health used data from the Influenza Genome Sequencing Project and concluded that during the tenyear period examined most of the time the hemagglutinin gene in HN showed no significant excess of mutations in the antigenic regions while an increasing variety of strains accumulated This resulted in one of the variants eventually achieving higher fitness becoming dominant and in a brief interval of rapid evolution rapidly sweeping through the population and eliminating most other variants
In the shortterm evolution of influenza A virus a  study found that stochastic or random processes are key factors Influenza A virus HA antigenic evolution appears to be characterized more by punctuated sporadic jumps as opposed to a constant rate of antigenic change Using phylogenetic analysis of  complete genomes of human influenza A viruses that were collected throughout the state of New York the authors of Nelson et al  were able to show that genetic diversity and not antigenic drift shaped the shortterm evolution of influenza A via random migration and reassortment  The evolution of these viruses is dominated more by the random importation of genetically different viral strains from other geographic locations and less by natural selection  Within a given season adaptive evolution is infrequent and had an overall weak effect as evidenced from the data gathered from the  genomes  Phylogenetic analysis revealed the different strains were derived from newly imported genetic material as opposed to isolates that had been circulating in New York in previous seasons  Therefore the gene flow in and out of this population and not natural selection was more important in the short term
Fowl act as natural asymptomatic carriers of influenza A viruses Prior to the currentwhen HN epizootic strains of influenza A virus had been demonstrated to be transmitted from wildfowl to only birds pigs horses seals whales and humans and only between humans and pigs and between humans and domestic fowl and not other pathways such as domestic fowl to horse
Wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a large variety of influenza A viruses Occasionally viruses are transmitted from these birds to other species and may then cause devastating outbreaks in domestic poultry or give rise to human influenza pandemics
HN has been shown to be transmitted to tigers leopards and domestic cats that were fed uncooked domestic fowl chickens with the virus HN viruses from horses have crossed over and caused outbreaks in dogs Laboratory mice have been infected successfully with a variety of avian flu genotypes
Influenza A viruses spread in the air and in manure and survives longer in cold weather They can also be transmitted by contaminated feed water equipment and clothing however there is no evidence the virus can survive in wellcooked meat Symptoms in animals vary but virulent strains can cause death within a few days Avian influenza viruses that the World Organisation for Animal Health and others test for to control poultry disease include HN HN HN HN HN HN HN HN HN HN HN HN HN HN HN HN and HN
 Outbreaks with significant spread to numerous farms resulting in great economic losses Most other outbreaks involved little or no spread from the initially infected farms 
More than  harbor seal deaths were recorded in New England between December  and October  from acute pneumonia caused by the influenza virus ASealMass HN
Influenza A virus has the following subtypes
