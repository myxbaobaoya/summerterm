Hepatitis D is a type of viral hepatitis caused by the hepatitis delta virus HDV HDV is one of five known hepatitis viruses A B C D and E HDV is considered to be a satellite a type of subviral agent because it can propagate only in the presence of the hepatitis B virus HBV Transmission of HDV can occur either via simultaneous infection with HBV coinfection or superimposed on chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis B carrier state superinfection 
HDV infecting a person with chronic hepatitis B superinfection is considered the most serious type of viral hepatitis due to its severity of complications These complications include a greater likelihood of experiencing liver failure in acute infections and a rapid progression to liver cirrhosis with an increased risk of developing liver cancer in chronic infections In combination with hepatitis B virus hepatitis D has the highest fatality rate of all the hepatitis infections at  A recent estimate from  suggests that currently  million persons are infected with this virus 
The hepatitis delta viruses or HDV are eight species of negativesense singlestranded RNA viruses or viruslike particles classified together as the genus Deltavirus within the realm Ribozyviria The HDV virion is a small spherical enveloped particle with a  nm diameter its viral envelope contains host phospholipids as well as three proteins taken from the hepatitis B virusthe large medium and small hepatitis B surface antigens This assembly surrounds an inner ribonucleoprotein RNP particle which contains the genome surrounded by about  molecules of hepatitis D antigen HDAg for each genome The central region of HDAg has been shown to bind RNA Several interactions are also mediated by a coiledcoil region at the N terminus of HDAg
The HDV genome is negative sense singlestranded closed circular RNA with a genome of approximately  nucleotides HDV is the smallest "virus" known to infect animals It has been proposed that HDV may have originated from a class of plant pathogens called viroids which are much smaller than viruses Its genome is unique among animal viruses because of its high GC nucleotide content Its nucleotide sequence is about  selfcomplementary allowing the genome to form a partially doublestranded rodlike RNA structure HDV strains are highly divergent fusions of different strains exist and sequences had been deposited in public databases employing different start sites for the circular viral DNA involved This had resulted in something of chaos with respect to molecular classification of this virus a situation which has been resolved recently with the adoption of a proposed reference genome and a uniform classification system
Like hepatitis B HDV gains entry into liver cells via the NTCP bile transporter HDV recognizes its receptor via the Nterminal domain of the large hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg Mapping by mutagenesis of this domain has shown that amino acid residues – make up the receptorbinding site After entering the hepatocyte the virus is uncoated and the nucleocapsid translocated to the nucleus due to a signal in HDAg Since the HDV genome does not code for an RNA polymerase to replicate the virus genome the virus makes use of the host cellular RNA polymerases Initially thought to use just RNA polymerase II now RNA polymerases I and III have also been shown to be involved in HDV replication
Normally RNA polymerase II utilizes DNA as a template and produces mRNA Consequently if HDV indeed utilizes RNA polymerase II during replication it would be the only known animal pathogen capable of using a DNAdependent polymerase as an RNAdependent polymerasecitation needed
The RNA polymerases treat the RNA genome as doublestranded DNA due to the folded rodlike structure it is in Three forms of RNA are made circular genomic RNA circular complementary antigenomic RNA and a linear polyadenylated antigenomic RNA which is the mRNA containing the open reading frame for the HDAg Synthesis of antigenomic RNA occurs in the nucleolus mediated by RNA polymerase I whereas synthesis of genomic RNA takes place in the nucleoplasm mediated by RNA polymerase II HDV RNA is synthesized first as linear RNA that contains many copies of the genome The genomic and antigenomic RNA contain a sequence of  nucleotides the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme that acts as a ribozyme which selfcleaves the linear RNA into monomers These monomers are then ligated to form circular RNA
A significant difference between viroids and HDV is that while viroids produce no proteins HDV is known to produce one protein namely HDAg It comes in two forms a kDa largeHDAg and a smallHDAg of kDa The Nterminals of the two forms are identical they differ by  more amino acids in the Cterminal of the large HDAg Both isoforms are produced from the same reading frame which contains an UAG stop codon at codon  which normally produces only the smallHDAg However editing by cellular enzyme adenosine deaminase changes the stop codon to UGG allowing the largeHDAg to be produced Despite having  identical sequences these two proteins play diverging roles during the course of an infection HDAgS is produced in the early stages of an infection and enters the nucleus and supports viral replication HDAgL in contrast is produced during the later stages of an infection acts as an inhibitor of viral replication and is required for assembly of viral particles Thus RNA editing by the cellular enzymes is critical to the virus life cycle because it regulates the balance between viral replication and virion assemblycitation needed
The HDV envelope protein has three of the HBV surface proteins anchored to it The S region of the genome is most commonly expressed and its main function is to assemble subviral particles HDV antigen proteins combine with the viral genome to form a ribonucleoprotein RNP which when enveloped with the subviral particles can form virallike particles that are almost identical to mature HDV but they are not infectious Researchers had concluded that the determinant of infectivity of HDV was within the Nterminal preS domain of the large protein L It was found to be a mediator in binding to the cellular receptor Researchers Georges Abou Jaoudé and Camille Sureau published an article in  that studied the role of the antigenic loop found in HDV envelope proteins in the infectivity of the virus The antigenic loop like the Nterminal preS domain of the large protein is exposed at the virion surface Jaoudé and Sureaus study provided evidence that the antigenic loop may be an important factor in HDV entry into the host cell and by mutating parts of the antigenic loop the infectivity of HDV may be minimized
The routes of transmission of hepatitis D are similar to those for hepatitis B Infection is largely restricted to persons at high risk of hepatitis B infection particularly injecting drug users and persons receiving clotting factor concentrates Worldwide more than  million people are coinfected HDV is rare in most developed countries and is mostly associated with intravenous drug use However HDV is much more common in the immediate Mediterranean region subSaharan Africa the Middle East and the northern part of South America In all about  million people may be infected with HDV
The vaccine for hepatitis B protects against hepatitis D virus because of the latters dependence on the presence of hepatitis B virus for it to replicate
In absence of a specific vaccine against delta virus the vaccine against HBV must be given soon after birth in risk groupscitation needed
Hepatitis D is generally considered the dominant virus over hepatitis B except in rare instances Current established treatments for chronic hepatitis D include conventional or pegylated interferon alpha therapy Latest evidence suggests that pegylated interferon alpha is effective in reducing the viral load and the effect of the disease during the time the drug is given but the benefit generally stops if the drug is discontinued The efficiency of this treatment does not usually exceed  and late relapse after therapy has been reported
In May  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency approved the antiviral Hepcludex bulevirtide to treat hepatitis D and B Bulevirtide binds and inactivates the sodiumbile acid cotransporter blocking both viruses from entering hepatocytes
Those afflicted are individuals who have been infected with Hepatitis B virus as the Hepatitis D HDV virus needs the HBsAg hepatitis B surface antigen for packaging and transmission The disease is present worldwide Infection with HDV is a major medical scourge in low income regions of the globe in which the HBV remains endemic It is therefore most prevalent in countries where HBV infection is also common currently the Amazon basin and low income regions of Asia and Africa Improved measures to control HBV in industrialised countries such as by vaccination have also reduced the prevalence of HDV with the main remaining atrisk populations in those countries being injection drug users and immigrants from endemic HDV areas
Hepatitis D virus was first reported in  as a nuclear antigen in patients infected with HBV who had severe liver disease This nuclear antigen was then thought to be a hepatitis B antigen and was called the delta antigen Subsequent experiments in chimpanzees showed that the hepatitis delta antigen HDAg was a structural part of a pathogen that required HBV infection to produce a complete viral particle The entire genome was cloned and sequenced in  It was subsequently placed in its own genus Deltavirus
Lábrea fever is a lethal tropical infection discovered in the s in the city of Lábrea in the Brazilian Amazon basin where it occurs mostly in the area south of the Amazon River in the states of Acre Amazonas and Rondônia The disease has also been diagnosed in Colombia and Peru It is now known to be a coinfection or superinfection of hepatitis B HBV with hepatitis D
Lábrea fever has a sudden onset with jaundice anorexia lack of appetite hematemesis vomiting of blood headache fever and severe prostration Death occurs by acute liver failure ALF In the last phase neurological symptoms such as agitation delirium convulsions and hemorrhagic coma commonly appear These symptoms arise from a fulminant hepatitis which may kill in less than a week and which characteristically affects children and young adults and more males than females It is accompanied also by an encephalitis in many cases The disease is highly lethal in a study carried out in  at Boca do Acre also in the Amazon  patients out of  died in the acute phase of the disease Survivors may develop chronic diseasecitation needed
The main discovery of delta virus and HBV association was done by Gilberta Bensabath of the Instituto Evandro Chagas of Belém state of Pará and her collaboratorscitation needed
Infected patients show extensive destruction of liver tissue with steatosis of a particular type microsteatosis characterized by small fat droplets inside the cells and infiltration of large numbers of inflammatory cells called morula cells comprised mainly by macrophages containing delta virus antigenscitation needed
In the  Boca do Acre study scientists did an epidemiological survey and reported delta virus infection in  of asymptomatic HBV carriers  of acute nonfulminant hepatitis B cases  of fulminant hepatitis B cases and  of chronic hepatitis B cases The delta virus seems to be endemic in the Amazon regioncitation needed
Three genotypes I–III were originally described Genotype I has been isolated in Europe North America Africa and some Asia Genotype II has been found in Japan Taiwan and Yakutia Russia Genotype III has been found exclusively in South America Peru Colombia and Venezuela Some genomes from Taiwan and the Okinawa islands have been difficult to type but have been placed in genotype  However it is now known that there are at least  genotypes of this virus HDV to HDV Phylogenetic studies suggest an African origin for this pathogen
An analysis of  strains of genotype  estimated that the most recent common ancestor of these strains originated around  This genotype spread exponentially from early s to the s in South America The substitution rate was estimated to be ×− substitutions per site per year Another study found an overall evolution rate of ×− substitutions per site per year The mutation rate varied with position  the hypervariable region evolved faster ×− substitutions per site per year than the hepatitis delta antigen coding region ×− substitutions per site per year and the autocatalytic region ×− substitutions per site per year A third study suggested a mutation rate between ×− to ×− substitutionssiteyear
Genotypes with the exception of type  appear to be restricted to certain geographical areas HDV previously HDVIIa is found in Japan Taiwan and Yakutia HDV previously HDVIIb in Japan and Taiwan HDV in the Amazonian region HDV HDV HDV and HDV in Africa Genotype  has also been isolated from South America This genotype is usually only found in Africa and may have been imported into South America during the slave trade
HDVspecific CD T cells can control the virus but it has been found HDV mutates to escape detection by CD T cells
A few other viruses with similarity to HDV have been described in species other than humans Unlike HDV none of them depend on a Hepadnaviridae HBV family virus to replicate These agents have rodlike structure a delta antigen and a ribozyme HDV and all such relatives are classified in their own realm Ribozyviria by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
