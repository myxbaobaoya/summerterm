Respiratory syncytial virus RSV also called human respiratory syncytial virus hRSV and human orthopneumovirus is a common contagious virus that causes infections of the respiratory tract It is a negativesense singlestranded RNA virus and its name is derived from the large cells known as syncytia that form when infected cells fuse
RSV is the single most common cause of respiratory hospitalization in infants and reinfection remains common in later life it is an important pathogen in all age groups Infection rates are typically higher during the cold winter months causing bronchiolitis in infants common colds in adults and more serious respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia in the elderly and immunocompromised
RSV is spread through contaminated air droplets and can cause outbreaks both in the community and in hospital settings Following initial infection via the eyes or nose the virus will infect the epithelial cells of the upper and lower airway causing inflammation cell damage and airway obstruction A variety of methods are available for viral detection and diagnosis of RSV including antigen testing molecular testing and viral culture While the main prevention measures include hand washing and avoiding close contact with infected individuals prophylactic use of palivizumab is available to prevent RSV infection in highrisk infants Currently there is no vaccine against RSV although many are under development

Treatment for severe illness is primarily supportive including oxygen therapy and more advanced breathing support with CPAP or nasal high flow oxygen as required In cases of severe respiratory failure intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required Ribavirin is the only antiviral medication currently licensed for the treatment of RSV in children although its use remains controversialmwparseroutput toclimit toclevel ulmwparseroutput toclimit toclevel ulmwparseroutput toclimit toclevel ulmwparseroutput toclimit toclevel ulmwparseroutput toclimit toclevel ulmwparseroutput toclimit toclevel uldisplaynoneRSV infection can present with a wide variety of signs and symptoms that range from mild upper respiratory tract infections URTI to severe and potentially lifethreatening lower respiratory tract infections LRTI requiring hospitalization and mechanical ventilation While RSV can cause respiratory tract infections in people of all ages and is among the most common childhood infections its presentation often varies between age groups and immune status Reinfection is common throughout life but infants and the elderly remain at highest risk for symptomatic infection
Most children will experience at least one RSV infection by age  Most childhood RSV infections are fairly selflimited with typical upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms such as nasal congestion runny nose cough and lowgrade fever Inflammation of the nasal mucosa rhinitis and throat pharyngitis as well as redness of the eyes conjunctival infection may be seen on exam Approximately – of children will go on to develop more serious lower respiratory tracts infections such as bronchiolitis viral pneumonia or croup Infants are at the highest risk of disease progression
Bronchiolitis is a common lower respiratory tract infection characterized by inflammation and obstruction of the small airways in the lungs While several viruses can cause bronchiolitis RSV is responsible for about  of cases It usually presents with  to  days of runny nose and congestion followed by worsening cough noisy breathing tachypnea fast breathing and wheezing As infants work harder to breathe they can also show signs of respiratory distress such as subcostal retractions when the belly pulls under the ribcage intercostal retractions when the muscles between the ribs pull inward grunting and nasal flaring If the child has not been able to feed adequately signs of dehydration may also be present Fever may be present but highgrade fever is uncommon Crackles and wheezing can often be heard on auscultation and oxygen saturation levels may be decreased
In very young infants under  weeks of age and particularly in premature infants signs of infection may be less specific They may have minimal respiratory involvement Instead they may exhibit decreased activity irritability poor feeding or breathing with difficulties This can also be accompanied by apneic spells or brief pauses in breathing
Reinfection with RSV remains common throughout life Reinfection in adulthood often produces only mild to moderate symptoms indistinguishable from the common cold or sinus infection Infection may also be asymptomatic If present symptoms are generally isolated to the upper respiratory tract runny nose sore throat fever and malaise In the vast majority of cases nasal congestion precedes the development of cough In contrast to other upper respiratory infections RSV is also more likely to cause new onset wheeze in adults Only about  of infected adults will progress to significant lower respiratory tract infection such as bronchitis or tracheobronchitis
While RSV very rarely causes severe disease in healthy adults it can cause significant morbidity and mortality in the elderly and in those with underlying immune compromise or cardiopulmonary disease Older adults have a similar presentation to younger adults but tend to have greater symptom severity with increased risk of lower respiratory tract involvement In particular the elderly are more likely to experience pneumonia respiratory distress and death
In both adults and children those who are immunocompromised are at an increased risk of severe infection with RSV Infected individuals in this group are more likely to progress from upper to lower respiratory tract involvement and have prolonged viral shedding Symptom severity seems to be closely related to the extent of immune suppression Those who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant HSCT intensive chemotherapy and lung transplant are particularly susceptible Bone marrow transplant patients appear to be at highest risk especially prior to marrow engraftment In this group RSV infection carries a nearly  risk of both pneumonia and death
Long term children are at risk of developing the following chronic conditions that may persist into adulthood
Risk factors for development of severe lower respiratory tract infection with RSV vary by population
RSV is a negativesense singlestranded RNA virus The scientific name for this viral species is Human orthopneumovirus This is synonymous with Human respiratory syncytial virus hRSV and is often shortened to just RSV It belongs to the genus Orthopneumovirus family Pneumoviridae order Mononegavirales Its name comes from the fact that F proteins on the surface of the virus cause neighboring cell membranes to merge creating large multinucleated syncytia
RSV is divided into two antigenic subtypes A and B based on the reactivity of the F and G surface proteins to monoclonal antibodies The subtypes tend to circulate simultaneously within local epidemics although subtype A tends to be more prevalent Generally RSV subtype A RSVA is thought to be more virulent than RSV subtype B RSVB with higher viral loads and faster transmission time To date  RSVA and  RSVB clades or strains have been identified Among RSVA the GA GA GA and GA clades predominate GA is found only in the United States Among RSVB the BA clade predominates worldwide
RSV has a negativesense singlestranded RNA genome The genome is linear and approximately  nucleotides in length It is nonsegmented which means that unlike influenza RSV cannot participate in the type of genetic reassortment and antigenic shifts responsible for large pandemics It has  genes encoding for  proteins The gene order is NSNSNPMSHGFML with the NS and NS gene serving as nonstructural promoter genes
RSV is a mediumsized  nm enveloped virus While most particles are spherical filamentous species have also been identified The genome rests within a helical nucleocapsid and is surrounded by matrix protein and an envelope containing viral glycoproteins There are  proteins described further in the table below  
Surface protein G glycoprotein is primarily responsible for viral attachment to host cells This protein is highly variable between strains G protein exists in both membranebound and secreted forms The membranefound form is responsible for attachment by binding to glycosaminoglycans GAGs such as heparan sulfate on the surface of host cells The secreted form acts as a decoy interacting with antigen presenting cells to inhibit antibodymediated neutralization G protein also contains a CXC fractalkinelike motif that binds to the CXC chemokine receptor  CXCR on the surface of ciliated bronchial host cells This binding may alter cellular chemotaxis and reduce the migration of immune cells into the lungs of infected individuals G protein also alters host immune response by inhibiting signaling from several tolllike receptors including TLR

Surface protein F fusion protein is responsible for fusion of viral  host cell membranes as well as syncytium formation between viral particles Its sequence is highly conserved between strains Interestingly while viral attachment appears to involve both F and G proteins F fusion occurs independently of G F protein exists in multiple conformational forms In the prefusion state PreF the protein exists in a trimeric form and contains the major antigenic site Ø Ø serves as a primary target of neutralizing antibodies in the body After binding to its target on the host cell surface its exact ligand remains unclear PreF undergoes a conformational change during which Ø is lost This change enables the protein to insert itself into the host cell membrane and leads to fusion of the viral and host cell membranes A final conformational shift results in a more stable and elongated form of the protein postfusion PostF Opposite of the RSV G protein the RSV F protein also binds to and activates tolllike receptor  TLR initiating the innate immune response and signal transductionFollowing fusion of the viral and host cell membranes the viral nucleocapsid containing the viral genome and the associated viral polymerase are delivered into the host cell cytoplasm Transcription and translation both occur within the cytoplasm RNAdependent RNA polymerase transcribes the genome into  segments of messenger RNA mRNA which is translated into structural proteins by host cell machinery During replication of the negativesense viral genome RNAdependent RNA polymerase synthesizes a positivesense complement called the antigenome This complementary strand is used as a template to construct genomic negativesense RNA which is packaged into nucleocapsids and transported to the plasma membrane for assembly and particle budding
RSV is highly contagious and can cause outbreaks from both community and hospital transmission For each person infected with RSV it is estimated that an average of  to  uninfected people will become infected RSV can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes releasing contaminated droplets into the air Transmission usually occurs when these droplets come into contact with another persons eyes nose or mouth RSV can also live for up to  minutes on contaminated skin ie hands and several hours on other surfaces like countertops and doorknobs It has an incubation period of  to  days Once infected people are usually contagious for  to  days In infants and in people with weakened immune systems however the virus may continue to spread for up to  weeks even after they are no longer showing symptoms
Following transmission through the nose or eyes RSV infects ciliated columnar epithelial cells of the upper and lower airway RSV continues to replicate within these bronchial cells for about  days After the first several days RSVinfected cells will become more rounded and ultimately slough into the smaller bronchioles of the lower airway This sloughing mechanism is also thought to be responsible for the spread of virus from the upper to lower respiratory tract Infection causes generalized inflammation within the lungs including the migration and infiltration of inflammatory cells such as monocytes and Tcells necrosis of the epithelial cell wall edema and increased mucous production Inflammation and cell damage tends to be patchy rather than diffuse Together the sloughed epithelial cells mucous plugs and accumulated immune cells cause obstruction of the lower airway
A variety of laboratory tests are available for the diagnosis of RSV infection While the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP does not routinely recommend the use of lab testing to diagnosis RSV bronchiolitis for which the treatment is largely supportive confirmation of RSV infection may be warranted in highrisk groups if the result will guide clinical decisions Common identification techniques include antigen testing molecular testing and viral culture
Antigen testing involves detection of RSV antigen fragments or pieces of molecular viral structures usually from an nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate This can be accomplished either by viewing fluorescently labeled antigens under a microscope direct fluorescence assay or DFA or using a commercially available rapid antigen detection test RADT Overall antigen testing is highly sensitive in young children – but substantially less reliable in older children and adults who have less viral shedding Antigen tests are also subject to higher false positive rates outside of the peak RSV season such as in the summer months In these scenarios the use of either viral culture or nucleic acid amplification testing NAAT may aid in an accurate RSV diagnosiscitation needed
Molecular assays such as nucleic acid amplification tests NAATs enable sensitive detection of very small amounts of virus in nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates NAAT assays such as polymerase chain reaction PCR detect virusspecific genetic material rather than viral antigens They have a sensitivity and specificity approaching  However they tend to be more expensive and require more complex equipment than other testing methods making them less practical in resource limited areas
In traditional viral culture a sample of the virus is introduced to different cell lines and allowed to replicate so it can be studied Benefits of this technique include the ability to perform genetic characterization strain typing and antiviral susceptibility testing However it is limited by its prolonged turnaround time of – days making it less common in patient care and more common in research settings
Serology the measurement of virusspecific antibodies in the serum is not frequently used in RSV diagnosis The time required for the body to mount a significant serologic response and demonstrate a significant rise in antibodies that can be detected in serum is usually not useful in guiding patient care Up to  of patients with documented RSV infection will have negative serology results As such this method is generally reserved for research and surveillance studies
Chest xrays findings in children with RSV bronchiolitis are generally nonspecific and include perihilar markings patchy hyperinflation and atelectasis However the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP does not recommend routine imaging for children with presumed RSV bronchiolitis because it does not change clinical outcomes and is associated with increased antibiotic use Chest xray is sometimes considered when the diagnosis of bronchiolitis is unclear or when there is an unexpected worsening In adults with RSV infection chest films are often normal or demonstrate nonspecific changes consistent with viral pneumonia such as patchy bilateral infiltrates
The differential diagnosis for individuals presenting with signs and symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infection includes other viral infections such as rhinovirus metapneumovirus and influenza and primary bacterial pneumonia In children inhaled foreign bodies and congenital conditions such as cystic fibrosis or asthma should also be considered
The main prevention measure is to avoid close contact with infected individuals In community and daycare settings careful hand washing can help reduce transmission In hospital settings strict adherence to infection control measures can help prevent the spread of RSV to highrisk individuals Alcoholbased disinfectants are recommended for hand decontamination
Although there is currently no vaccine against RSV passive immunization is available to prevent RSV infection and hospitalization in the highest risk infants Historically RSVspecific intravenous immunoglobin IVIG was used to provide passive immunity This involved monthly administration of RSVneutralizing antibodies or immunoglobins from human donors recovering from the disease While this transfer of antibodies was reasonably effective in providing shortterm immunization to atrisk infants it was limited by both its intravenous administration and cost
RSVIVIG has since been replaced with the use of a monoclonal antibody MAb that can be delivered through muscular injection While several monoclonal antibodies have been developed for RSV prophylaxis the most successful of these has been Palivizumab brand name Synagis Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the surface fusion F protein of the RSV virus It was licensed in  and is effective in providing temporary prophylaxis against both RSV A and B It is given by monthly injections which are begun just prior to the RSV season and are usually continued for five months Palivizumab has been shown to reduce both hospitalization rates and allcause mortality in certain groups of highrisk children such as those with chronic lung disease congenital heart disease and those born preterm However its cost limits its use in many parts of the world More potent derivatives of this antibody have since been developed including motavizumab but were associated with considerable adverse events
The American Academy of Pediatrics AAP  recommends RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab during RSV season for
Per AAP guidelines palivizumab prophylaxis may also be considered in infants with
On  Mar  results of the Phase III Melody trial of Nirsevimab a "potential immunisation forinfants" were published in the New England Journal of Medicine
Currently there is no licensed vaccine to prevent infection by RSV There has been tremendous interest and research in RSV vaccine discovery given the viruss significant disease burden and the relative lack of diseasespecific therapies However vaccine development has faced significant obstacles that have blocked its progress Among these are infantspecific factors such as the immature infant immune system and the presence of maternal antibodies which make infantile immunization difficult
Attempts to develop an RSV vaccine began in the s with a formalininactivated vaccine that was developed for use in infants and children While a similar method was used to create a safe and effective poliovirus vaccine this vaccine resulted in a dangerous phenomenon that came to be known as vaccineassociated enhanced respiratory disease VAERD In VAERD the vaccinated infants went on to develop significantly worse respiratory disease than nonvaccinated infants during subsequent natural infection Some  of such children vs  of virusexposed controls were hospitalized with two cases leading to death This disaster led to extreme caution and hindered vaccine development for many years
A  paper claimed that research toward vaccine development had greatly advanced over the preceding – years with more than  candidates in some stage of development The same study predicted that a vaccine would be available within  years The types of vaccines currently in research fall into five broad categories liveattenuated protein subunit vectorbased particlebased and messenger RNA Each targets different immune responses and thus may be better suited to prevent disease in different atrisk groups Liveattenuated vaccines have shown some success in RSVnaive infants Other vaccine candidates hope to target vulnerable populations across the lifespan including pregnant women and the elderly
Treatment for RSV infection is focused primarily on supportive care This may include monitoring a patients breathing or using suction to remove secretions from the upper airway Supplemental oxygen may also be delivered though a nasal cannula or face mask in order to improve airflow In severe cases of respiratory failure intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing If signs of dehydration are present fluids may also be given orally or through an IV
Additional supportive treatments have been investigated specifically in infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis These include the following
Bronchodilators medications commonly used to treat asthma are sometimes used to treat the wheezing associated with RSV infection   These medications such as albuterol or salbutamol are betaagonists that relax the muscles of the airways to allow for improved airflow However bronchodilators have not been found to improve clinical severity of infection or rate of hospitalization among those with RSV infection Given their limited benefit plus their adverse event profile they are not routinely recommended for use in RSV bronchiolitis
Antibiotic therapy is not appropriate for treatment of RSVrelated bronchiolitis or viral pneumonia Antibiotics target bacterial pathogens not viral pathogens such as RSV However antibiotics may be considered if there is clear evidence that a secondary bacterial infection has developed Ear infections may also develop in a small number of infants with RSV bronchiolitis in which case oral antibiotics may sometimes be used
Worldwide RSV is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and children under the age of  The risk of serious infection is highest during the first  months of life Of those infected with RSV – will develop bronchiolitis necessitating hospitalization Each year approximately  million acute respiratory illnesses and over  childhood deaths are caused by RSV worldwide An estimated  of infants will have experienced an RSV infection by the age of  months and nearly all children will have been infected by  years In the United States RSV is responsible for up to  of acute respiratory infection hospitalizations in children under the age of  However the vast majority of RSVrelated deaths occur in lowincome countries that lack access to basic supportive care
It is rare for healthy young adults to develop severe illness requiring hospitalization from RSV However it is now recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in certain adult populations including the elderly and those with underlying heart or lung diseases Its clinical impact among elderly adults is estimated to be similar  to that of influenza Each year approximately  of nursing home residents will experience RSV infection with significant rates of pneumonia and death RSV is also responsible for  of adult communityacquired pneumonias
In both adults and children immunosuppression increases susceptibility to RSV infection Children living with HIV are more likely to develop acute illness and are  times more likely to require hospitalization than children without HIV Bone marrow transplant patients prior to marrow engraftment are at particularly high risk with RSV accounting for nearly half of the viral infections in this population This group has also demonstrated mortality rates of up to  among those with RSV pneumonia While infection may occur within the community hospitalacquired infection is thought to account for  of cases among immunocompromised individuals
RSV seasonality varies around the world In temperate climates infection rates tend to be highest during the cold winter months This is often attributed to increased indoor crowding and increased viral stability in the lower temperatures In tropical and arctic climates however the annual variation is less well defined and seems to be more prevalent during the rainy season Annual epidemics are generally caused by the presence of several different viral strains Subtype A and B viruses will often circulate simultaneously within a specific geographic region although group A viruses are more prevalent
The COVID pandemic resulted in a significant decline in the prevalence of RSV  There was then a significant unseasonal rebound when lockdowns and other restrictive measures were relaxed
RSV was first discovered in  when researchers isolated a virus from a population of chimpanzees with respiratory illness They named the virus CCA Chimpanzee Coryza Agent although it was later realized that the chimpanzees caught the infection from their caretakers In  this same virus was identified by Robert M Chanock in children with respiratory illness Studies of human antibodies in infants and children revealed that the infection was common in early life The virus was later renamed human orthopneumovirus or human respiratory syncytial virus hRSV
Several other pneumoviruses exist that show great similarity to hRSV Most notable of these is bovine RSV bRSV which shares approximately  of its genome with hRSV It also shares hRSVs predilection for the young causing more severe disease in calves less than  months old Because bRSVinfected calves have an almost identical presentation to hRSVinfected children this has proven to be an important animal model in RSV research
