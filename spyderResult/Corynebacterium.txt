Corynebacterium kɔːˈraɪnəbækˌtɪəriəm ˈrɪn is a genus of bacteria that are Grampositive and most are aerobic They are bacilli rodshaped and in some phases of life they are more specifically clubshaped which inspired the genus name coryneform means "clubshaped"
They are widely distributed in nature in the microbiota of animals including the human microbiota and are mostly innocuous most commonly existing in commensal relationships with their hosts  Some are useful in industrial settings such as C glutamicum Others can cause human disease including most notably diphtheria which is caused by C diphtheriae As with various species of a microbiota including their relatives in the genera Arcanobacterium and Trueperella they usually are not pathogenic but can occasionally opportunistically capitalize on atypical access to tissues via wounds or weakened host defenses
The genus Corynebacterium was created by Lehmann and Neumann in  as a taxonomic group to contain the bacterial rods responsible for causing diphtheria The genus was defined based on morphological characteristics Based on studies of SrRNA they have been grouped into the subdivision of Grampositive Eubacteria with high GC content with close phylogenetic relationship to Arthrobacter Mycobacterium Nocardia and Streptomyces
The term comes from Greek κορύνη korýnē club mace staff knobby plant bud or shoot and βακτήριον baktḗrion little rod  The term "diphtheroids" is used to represent corynebacteria that are nonpathogenic for example C diphtheriae would be excludedcitation needed The term diphtheroid comes from Greek διφθέρα diphthérā prepared hide leather
Comparative analysis of corynebacterial genomes has led to the identification of several conserved signature indels CSIs that are unique to the genus Two examples of CSIs are a twoaminoacid insertion in a conserved region of the enzyme phosphoribose diphosphatedecaprenylphosphate phosphoribosyltransferase and a threeaminoacid insertion in acetate kinase both of which are found only in Corynebacterium species Both of these indels serve as molecular markers for species of the genus Corynebacterium Additionally  conserved signature proteins which are uniquely found in Corynebacterium species have been identified Three of these have homologs found in the genus Dietzia which is believed to be the closest related genus to Corynebacterium In phylogenetic trees based on concatenated protein sequences or S rRNA the genus Corynebacterium forms a distinct clade within which is a distinct subclade cluster I The cluster is made up of the species C diphtheriae C pseudotuberculosis C ulcerans C aurimucosum C glutamicum and C efficiens This cluster is distinguished by several conserved signature indels such as a twoaminoacid insertion in LepA and a seven or eightaminoacid insertions in RpoC Also  conserved signature proteins are found only in members of cluster I Another cluster has been proposed consisting of C jeikeium and C urealyticum which is supported by the presence of  distinct conserved signature proteins which are unique to these two species Corynebateria have a high GC content ranging from  mol
The principal features of the genus Corynebacterium were described by Collins and Cummins in  They are grampositive catalasepositive nonsporeforming nonmotile rodshaped bacteria that are straight or slightly curved Metachromatic granules are usually present representing stored phosphate regions Their size falls between  and  μm in length and  μm in diameter The bacteria group together in a characteristic way which has been described as the form of a "V" "palisades" or "Chinese characters" They may also appear elliptical They are aerobic or facultatively anaerobic chemoorganotrophs They are pleomorphic through their lifecycles they occur in various lengths and they frequently have thickenings at either end depending on the surrounding conditions
Some corynebacteria are lipophilic such as CDC coryneform groups F and G C accolens C afermentans subsp lipophilum C bovis C jeikeium C macginleyi C uropygiale and C urealyticum but most are notcitation needed The nonlipophilic bacteria may be classified as fermentative such as C amycolatum C argentoratense members of the C diphtheriae group C glucuronolyticum C glutamicum C matruchotii C minutissimum C striatum and C xerosis or nonfermentative such as C afermentans subsp afermentans C auris C pseudodiphtheriticum and C propinquum
The cell wall is distinctive with a predominance of mesodiaminopimelic acid in the murein wall and many repetitions of arabinogalactan as well as corynemycolic acid a mycolic acid with  to  carbon atoms bound by disaccharide bonds called LRhap → DGlcNAcphosphate These form a complex commonly seen in Corynebacterium species the mycolylAG–peptidoglican mAGP Unlike most corynebacteria Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii does not contain mycolic acids
Corynebacteria grow slowly even on enriched media In nutritional requirements all need biotin to grow Some strains also need thiamine and PABA Some of the Corynebacterium species with sequenced genomes have between  and  million base pairs The bacteria grow in Loefflers medium blood agar and trypticase soy agar TSA They form small grayish colonies with a granular appearance mostly translucent but with opaque centers convex with continuous borders The color tends to be yellowishwhite in Loefflers medium In TSA they can form grey colonies with black centers and dentated borders that either resemble flowers C gravis continuous borders C mitis or a mix between the two forms C intermedium
Corynebacterium species occur commonly in nature in soil water plants and food products The nondiphtheiroid Corynebacterium species can even be found in the mucosa and normal skin flora of humans and animals Unusual habitats such as the preen gland of birds have been recently reported for Corynebacterium uropygiale Some species are known for their pathogenic effects in humans and other animals Perhaps the most notable one is C diphtheriae which acquires the capacity to produce diphtheria toxin only after interacting with a bacteriophage Other pathogenic species in humans include C amycolatum C striatum C jeikeium C urealyticum and C xerosis all of these are important as pathogens in immunosuppressed patients Pathogenic species in other animals include C bovis and C renale This genus has been found to be part of the human salivary microbiome
The most notable human infection is diphtheria caused by C diphtheriae It is an acute contagious infection characterized by pseudomembranes of dead epithelial cells white blood cells red blood cells and fibrin that form around the tonsils and back of the throat In developed countries it is an uncommon illness that tends to occur in unvaccinated individuals especially schoolaged children elderly neutropenic or immunocompromised patients and those with prosthetic devices such as prosthetic heart valves shunts or catheters It is more common in developing countries  It can occasionally infect wounds the vulva the conjunctiva and the middle ear It can be spread within a hospital The virulent and toxigenic strains produce an exotoxin formed by two polypeptide chains which is itself produced when a bacterium is transformed by a gene from the β prophage
Several species cause disease in animals most notably C pseudotuberculosis which causes the disease caseous lymphadenitis and some are also pathogenic in humans Some attack healthy hosts while others tend to attack the immunocompromised Effects of infection include granulomatous lymphadenopathy pneumonitis pharyngitis skin infections and endocarditis Corynebacterial endocarditis is seen most frequently in patients with intravascular devices Several species of Corynebacterium can cause trichomycosis axillaris C striatum may cause axillary odor C minutissimum causes erythrasma
Nonpathogenic species of Corynebacterium are used for important industrial applications such as the production of amino acids nucleotides and other nutritional factors Martín  bioconversion of steroids degradation of hydrocarbons cheese aging and production of enzymes Some species produce metabolites similar to antibiotics bacteriocins of the corynecinlinocin type antitumor agents etc One of the most studied species is C glutamicum whose name refers to its capacity to produce glutamic acid in aerobic conditions This is used in the food industry as monosodium glutamate in the production of soy sauce and yogurtcitation needed
Species of Corynebacterium have been used in the mass production of various amino acids including glutamic acid a food additive that is made at a rate of  million tons year The metabolic pathways of Corynebacterium  have been further manipulated to produce lysine and threoninecitation needed
LLysine production is specific to C glutamicum in which core metabolic enzymes are manipulated through genetic engineering to drive metabolic flux towards the production of NADPH from the pentose phosphate pathway and Laspartyl phosphate the commitment step to the synthesis of Llysine lysC dapA dapC and dapF These enzymes are upregulated in industry through genetic engineering to ensure adequate amounts of lysine precursors are produced to increase metabolic flux Unwanted side reactions such as threonine and asparagine production can occur if a buildup of intermediates occurs so scientists have developed mutant strains of C glutamicum through PCR engineering and chemical knockouts to ensure production of sidereaction enzymes are limited Many genetic manipulations conducted in industry are by traditional crossover methods or inhibition of transcriptional activators
Expression of functionally active human epidermal growth factor has been brought about in C glutamicum thus demonstrating a potential for industrialscale production of human proteins Expressed proteins can be targeted for secretion through either the general secretory pathway or the twinarginine translocation pathway
Unlike gramnegative bacteria the grampositive Corynebacterium species lack lipopolysaccharides that function as antigenic endotoxins in humanscitation needed
