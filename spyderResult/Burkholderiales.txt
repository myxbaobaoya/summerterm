The Burkholderiales are an order of Pseudomonadota. Like all Pseudomonadota, they are Gramnegative. They include several pathogenic bacteria, including species of Burkholderia, Bordetella, and Ralstonia. They also include Oxalobacter and related genera, which are unusual in using oxalic acid as their source of carbon. Other wellstudied genera include Alcaligenes, Cupriavidus, Achromobacter, Comamonas, Delftia, Massilia, Duganella, Janthinobacterium, Polynucleobacter important freshwater bacterioplankton, nonpathogenic Paraburkholderia, Caballeronia, Polaromonas, Thiomonas, Collimonas, Hydrogenophaga, Sphaerotilus, Variovorax, Acidovorax, Rubrivivax and Rhodoferax both members of the photosynthetic purple nonsulfur bacteria, and Herbaspirillum capable of nitrogenfixation.
