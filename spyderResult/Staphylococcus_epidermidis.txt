Staphylococcus albus Rosenbach 
Staphylococcus epidermidis is a Grampositive bacterium and one of over  species belonging to the genus Staphylococcus It is part of the normal human flora typically the skin flora and less commonly the mucosal flora and also found in marine sponges It is a facultative anaerobic bacteria  Although S epidermidis is not usually pathogenic patients with compromised immune systems are at risk of developing infection These infections are generally hospitalacquired  S epidermidis is a particular concern for people with catheters or other surgical implants because it is known to form biofilms that grow on these devices  Being part of the normal skin flora S epidermidis is a frequent contaminant of specimens sent to the diagnostic laboratory 
Some strains of S epidermidis are highly salt tolerant and commonly found in marine environment SI Paul et al  isolated and identified salt tolerant strains of S epidermidis strains ISPA ISPB and ISPC from Cliona viridis sponges of the Saint Martins Island Area of the Bay of Bengal Bangladesh

Friedrich Julius Rosenbach distinguished S epidermidis from S aureus in  initially naming S epidermidis as S albus  He chose aureus and albus since the bacteria formed yellow and white colonies respectively
Staphylococcus epidermidis is a very hardy microorganism consisting of nonmotile Grampositive cocci arranged in grapelike clusters It forms white raised cohesive colonies about – mm in diameter after overnight incubation and is not hemolytic on blood agar It is a catalasepositive coagulasenegative facultative anaerobe that can grow by aerobic respiration or by fermentation Some strains may not ferment
Biochemical tests indicate this microorganism also carries out a weakly positive reaction to the nitrate reductase test It is positive for urease production is oxidase negative and can use glucose sucrose and lactose to form acid products In the presence of lactose it will also produce gas Nonpathogenic S epidermidis unlike pathogenic S aureus does not possess the gelatinase enzyme so it cannot hydrolyze gelatin  It is sensitive to novobiocin providing an important test to distinguish it from Staphylococcus saprophyticus which is coagulasenegative as well but novobiocinresistant
Similar to those of S aureus the cell walls of S epidermidis have a transferrinbinding protein that helps the organism obtain iron from transferrin The tetramers of a surface exposed protein glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase are believed to bind to transferrin and remove its iron Subsequent steps include iron being transferred to surface lipoproteins then to transport proteins which carry the iron into the cell
Colony morphological physiological and biochemical characteristics of marine S epidermidis are shown in the table below

The ability to form biofilms on plastic devices is a major virulence factor for S epidermidis One probable cause is surface proteins that bind blood and extracellular matrix proteins
It produces an extracellular material known as polysaccharide intercellular adhesin PIA which is made up of sulfated polysaccharides  It allows other bacteria to bind to the already existing biofilm creating a multilayer biofilm
Such biofilms decrease the metabolic activity of bacteria within them This decreased metabolism in combination with impaired diffusion of antibiotics makes it difficult for antibiotics to effectively clear this type of infection
S epidermidis strains are often resistant to antibiotics including rifamycin fluoroquinolones gentamicin tetracycline clindamycin and sulfonamides Methicillin resistance is particularly widespread with  of hospital isolates resistance to methicillin Resistant organisms are most commonly found in the intestine but organisms living freely on the skin can also become resistant due to routine exposure to antibiotics secreted in sweat
As mentioned above S epidermidis causes biofilms to grow on plastic devices placed within the body This occurs most commonly on intravenous catheters and on medical prostheses Infection can also occur in dialysis patients or anyone with an implanted plastic device that may have been contaminated It also causes endocarditis most often in patients with defective heart valves In some other cases sepsis can occur in hospital patientscitation needed
Antibiotics are largely ineffective in clearing biofilms  The most common treatment for these infections is to remove or replace the infected implant though in all cases prevention is ideal The drug of choice is often vancomycin to which rifampin or an aminoglycoside can be addedcitation needed Hand washing has been shown to reduce the spread of infection
Preliminary research also indicates S epidermidis is universally found inside affected acne vulgaris pores where Cutibacterium acnes is normally the sole resident
Staphylococcus epidermidis in the normal skin is nonpathogenic But in abnormal lesions it becomes pathogenic likely in acne vulgaris Staphylococcus epidermidis enters the sebaceous gland colonized by Propionibacterium acnes the main bacterium that causes acne vulgaris and damages the hair follicles by producing lipolytic enzymes that change the sebum from fraction to dense thick form leading to inflammatory effect
Moreover S epidermidis biofilm formation by releasing the exopolysaccharide intercellular adhesion PIA provides the susceptible anaerobic environment to P acnes colonisation and protects it from the innate human immunity molecules
Both P acnes and S epidermidis can interact to protect the host skin health from pathogens colonisation But in the case of competition they use the same carbon source ie glycerol to produce short chain fatty acids which act as antibacterial agent against each other Also S epidermidis helps in skin homeostasis and reduces the P acnes pathogenic inflammation by decreasing the TLR protein production that induces the skin inflammation
The normal practice of detecting S epidermidis is by using appearance of colonies on selective media bacterial morphology by light microscopy catalase and slide coagulase testing Zobell agar is useful for the isolation of Staphylococcus epidermidis from marine organisms On the BairdParker agar with egg yolk supplement colonies appear small and black Increasingly techniques such as quantitative PCR are being employed for the rapid detection and identification of Staphylococcus strains Normally sensitivity to desferrioxamine can also be used to distinguish it from most other staphylococci except in the case of Staphylococcus hominis which is also sensitive In this case the production of acid from trehalose by S hominis can be used to tell the two species apart
