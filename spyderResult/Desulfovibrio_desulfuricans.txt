Desulfovibrio desulfuricans is a Gramnegative sulfatereducing bacteria. It is generally found in soils, waters, and the stools of animals, although in rare cases it has been found to cause infection in humans. It is particularly noted for its ability to produce methyl mercury. Also the 'reductive glycine pathway', a seventh route for organisms to capture CO, was discovered in this species. Since these bacteria are killed  by exposure to atmospheric oxygen, the environmental niches most frequently  occupied by these bacteria are anaerobic. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans  was reported to produce gene transfer agents
Desulfovibrio desulfuricans has been described as a motile, rodshaped,  Gramnegative obligate anaerobe with polar flagella. It measures approximately μm by .μm.
