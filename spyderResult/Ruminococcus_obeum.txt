Ruminococcus obeum
Blautia obeum is a species of anaerobic, grampositive bacteria found in the gut.
It has been shown that B. obeum along with other relevant taxa play an important role both in the recovery process from Vibrio cholerae infection and microbiota maturation in children. Moreover, experiments in model mice show that B. obeum strain AI reduces the pathogenicity of V. cholerae. The data show that the expression of quorum sensing autoinducers by B. obeum is increased in V. cholera infections and they repress the expression of several V. cholera virulence factors.citation needed
