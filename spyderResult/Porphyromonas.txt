Porphyromonas is a Gramnegative, nonsporeforming, obligately anaerobic and nonmotile genus from the family of Porphyromonadaceae. This genus has been found to be part of the salivary microbiome. The use of targeted S rRNA gene metagenomic sequencing has shown that the genus is well represented in healthy individuals from the Human Microbiome Project.
