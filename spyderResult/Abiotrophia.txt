The genus contains  species of coccus shaped species,  are former members of the genus Streptococcus, which were transferred in  to the newly coined genus Abiotrophia:
Other  are latter additions:
In , Collins and Lawsons further differentiated A. adiacens, A. balaenopterae and A. elegans from A. defectiva by placing them into the new genus Granulicatella.
The name Abiotrophia derives from:
Greek prefix ἄ a, negative un; Greek noun βιος bios, life; Greek noun τροφιά trophia, nutrition; New Latin feminine gender noun Abiotrophia, lifenutritiondeficiency.
For the Human Microbiome Project HMP, the genome of Abiotrophia defectiva ATCC   has been sequenced assembly as it is a resident of human oral cavity and urogenital and intestinal tracts and is a cause of infective endocarditis,
showing it to have  protein encoded in a . Mbp genome with a GC content of .

Formerly classified as nutritionally variant streptococci, A. elegans had been identified as a cause of  to  of blood culture negative bacterial endocarditis.
