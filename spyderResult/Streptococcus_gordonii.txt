Streptococcus gordonii is a Grampositive bacterium included among some of the initial colonizers of the periodontal environment.  The organism, along with related oral streptococci, has a high affinity for molecules in the salivary pellicle or coating on tooth surfaces.  S. gordonii therefore can rapidly colonize clean tooth surfaces, and S. gordonii along with related organisms comprise a high percentage, up to , of the bacterial biofilm that forms on clean tooth surfaces.  Generally harmless in the mouth, S. gordonii can cause acute bacterial endocarditis upon gaining access systemically. S. gordonii also forms an attachment substratum for later colonizers of tooth surface and can modulate the pathogenicity of these secondary colonizers through interspecies communication mechanisms.
The whole genome sequence of S. gordonii CCUG  type strain was deposited and published in DNA Data Bank of Japan, European Nucleotide Archive and GenBank in  under the accession number LQWV.
