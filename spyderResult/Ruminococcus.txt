Ruminococcus is a genus of bacteria in the class Clostridia. They are anaerobic, Grampositive gut microbes. One or more species in this genus are found in significant numbers in the human gut microbiota. The type species is R. flavefaciens. As usual, bacteria taxonomy is in flux, with Clostridia being paraphyletic, and some erroneous members of Ruminococcus being reassigned to a new genus Blautia on the basis of S rRNA gene sequences.
One of the most highly cited papers involving the genus Ruminococcus is a paper describing interspecies hydrogen transfer between Ruminococcus albus and Wolinella succinogenes.
In , Ruminococcus bromii was reportedly found in the human gut, which was the first of several species discovered. They may play a role in plant cell wall breakdown in the colon.
One study found that R. albus, R. callidus, and R. bromii are less abundant in people with inflammatory bowel disease. Ruminococcus are also less abundant in patients with Parkinson's disease. R. gnavus is associated with Crohn's disease.
Species belonging to the Lachnospiraceae family and therefore in need of reclassification:
