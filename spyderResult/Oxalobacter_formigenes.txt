Oxalobacter formigenes is a Gram negative oxalatedegrading anaerobic bacterium that was first isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of a sheep in . To date, the bacterium has been found to colonizes the large intestines of numerous vertebrates, including humans, and has even been isolated from freshwater sediment. It processes oxalate by decarboxylation into formate oxalylCoA decarboxylase, producing energy for itself in the process.
The broadspectrum quinolone antibiotics kill O. formigenes.citation needed If a person's gastrointestinal GI tract lacks this bacterium, and therefore lacks the primary source for the oxalylCoA decarboxylase enzyme, then the GI tract cannot degrade dietary oxalates which on digestion get absorbed easily and after some vitamin Bmodulated partial metabolic degradation in the body, is excreted in the kidney, where it precipitates with calcium to form calcium oxalate kidney stones.

 Oxalobacter formigenes can protect against kidney stones by degrading oxalate.
The role and presence of O. formigenes in the human gut is an area of active research.
