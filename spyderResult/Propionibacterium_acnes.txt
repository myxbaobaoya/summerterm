Cutibacterium acnes formerly Propionibacterium acnes is the relatively slowgrowing typically aerotolerant anaerobic grampositive bacterium rod linked to the skin condition of acne it can also cause chronic blepharitis and endophthalmitis the latter particularly following intraocular surgery Its genome has been sequenced and a study has shown several genes can generate enzymes for degrading skin and proteins that may be immunogenic activating the immune system
The species is largely commensal and part of the skin flora present on most healthy adult humans skin  It is usually just barely detectable on the skin of healthy preadolescents  It lives among other things primarily on fatty acids in sebum secreted by sebaceous glands in the follicles It may also be found throughout the gastrointestinal tract
Originally identified as Bacillus acnes it was later named Propionibacterium acnes for its ability to generate propionic acid In  P acnes was taxonomically reclassified as a result of biochemical and genomic studies In terms of both phylogenetic tree structure and DNA G  C content the cutaneous species was distinguishable from other species that had been previously categorized as P acnes  As part of restructuring the novel genus Cutibacterium was created for the cutaneous species including those formerly identified as Propionibacterium acnes Propionibacterium avidum and Propionibacterium granulosum Characterization of phylotypes of C acnes is an active field of research
C acnes bacteria predominantly live deep within follicles and pores although they are also found on the surface of healthy skin  In these follicles C acnes bacteria use sebum cellular debris and metabolic byproducts from the surrounding skin tissue as their primary sources of energy and nutrients  Elevated production of sebum by hyperactive sebaceous glands sebaceous hyperplasia or blockage of the follicle can cause C acnes bacteria to grow and multiply
C acnes bacteria secrete many proteins including several digestive enzymes  These enzymes are involved in the digestion of sebum and the acquisition of other nutrients  They can also destabilize the layers of cells that form the walls of the follicle  The cellular damage metabolic byproducts and bacterial debris produced by the rapid growth of C acnes in follicles can trigger inflammation  This inflammation can lead to the symptoms associated with some common skin disorders such as folliculitis and acne vulgaris Acne vulgaris is the disease most commonly associated with C acnes infection
Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit which includes the hair follicle hair shaft and sebaceous gland and about  million people are affected globally by this disease C acnes starts to colonize on the skin around  to  years prior to puberty and grows exponentially during this time This is why so many teens and young adults struggle with acne Prescriptions to treat acne are often antibiotics However with the rise of antibiotic resistance other medications like isotretinoin commonly known as Accutane are being used on patients with severe or resistant acnecitation needed
The damage caused by C acnes and the associated inflammation make the affected tissue more susceptible to colonization by opportunistic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus Preliminary research shows healthy pores are only colonized by C acnes while unhealthy ones universally include the nonporeresident Staphylococcus epidermidis amongst other bacterial contaminants  Whether this is a root causality just opportunistic and a side effect or a more complex pathological duality between C acnes and this particular Staphylococcus species is not known Current research has pointed to the idea that C acnes and S epidermidis have a symbiotic relationship Both bacteria exist on the normal flora of the skin and a disrupt in balance of these bacteria on the skin can result in acne or other bacterial infection
C acnes is a common cause of chronic endophthalmitis following cataract surgery The pathogen may also cause corneal ulcers
C acnes has been found in herniated discs The propionic acid which it secretes creates microfractures of the surrounding bone These microfractures are sensitive and it has been found that antibiotics have been helpful in resolving this type of low back pain
C acnes can be found in bronchoalveolar lavage of approximately  of patients with sarcoidosis and is associated with disease activity but it can also be found in  of controls  The subspecies of C acnes that cause these infections of otherwise sterile tissues prior to medical procedures however are the same subspecies found on the skin of individuals who do not have acneprone skin so are likely local contaminants  Moderate to severe acne vulgaris appears to be more often associated with virulent strains
C acnes is often considered an opportunistic pathogen causing a range of postoperative and devicerelated infections eg surgical infections postneurosurgical infections infected joint prostheses especially shoulder neurosurgical shunt infections and endocarditis in patients with prosthetic heart valves predominantly men C acnes may play a role in other conditions including  SAPHO synovitis acne pustulosis hyperostosis osteitis syndrome sarcoidosis and sciatica It is also suspected a main bacterial source of neuroinflammation in Alzheimers disease brains It is a common contaminant in blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures
C acnes bacteria are susceptible to a wide range of antimicrobial molecules from both pharmaceutical and natural sources The antibiotics most frequently used to treat acne vulgaris are erythromycin clindamycin doxycycline and minocycline  Several other families of antibiotics are also active against C acnes bacteria including quinolones cephalosporins pleuromutilins penicillins and sulfonamides
The emergence of antibioticresistant C acnes bacteria represents a growing problem worldwide  The problem is especially pronounced in North America and Europe  The antibiotic families that C acnes are most likely to acquire resistance to are the macrolides eg erythromycin and azithromycin lincosamides eg clindamycin and tetracyclines eg doxycycline and minocycline
However C acnes bacteria are susceptible to many types of antimicrobial chemicals found in overthecounter antibacterial products including benzoyl peroxide triclosan chloroxylenol and chlorhexidine gluconate
Several naturally occurring molecules and compounds are toxic to C acnes bacteria  Some essential oils such as rosemary tea tree oil clove oil and citrus oils contain antibacterial chemicals Natural honey has also been shown to have some antibacterial properties that may be active against C acnes
The elements silver sulfur and copper have also been demonstrated to be toxic towards many bacteria including C acnes
C acnes glows orange when exposed to blacklight possibly due to the presence of endogenous porphyrins It is also killed by ultraviolet light C acnes is especially sensitive to light in the – nanometer near the ultraviolet range due to an endogenic porphyrin–coporphyrin III A total irradiance of  Joulescm inactivates this species in vitro Its photosensitivity can be enhanced by pretreatment with aminolevulinic acid which boosts production of this chemical although this causes significant side effects in humans and in practice was not significantly better than the light treatment alone
C acnes has been found to be an endophyte of plants Notably grapevine appears to host an endophytic population of C acnes that is closely related to the humanassociated strains The two lines diverged roughly  years ago at about the same time when grapevine agriculture may have been established  This C acnes subtype was dubbed Zappae in honour of the eccentric composer Frank Zappa to highlight its unexpected and unconventional habitat
