Staphylococcus aureus is a Grampositive roundshaped bacterium a member of the Bacillota and is a usual member of the microbiota of the body frequently found in the upper respiratory tract and on the skin It is often positive for catalase and nitrate reduction and is a facultative anaerobe that can grow without the need for oxygen Although S aureus usually acts as a commensal of the human microbiota it can also become an opportunistic pathogen being a common cause of skin infections including abscesses respiratory infections such as sinusitis and food poisoning Pathogenic strains often promote infections by producing virulence factors such as potent protein toxins and the expression of a cellsurface protein that binds and inactivates antibodies S aureus is one of the leading pathogens for deaths associated with antimicrobial resistance and the emergence of antibioticresistant strains such as methicillinresistant S aureus MRSA is a worldwide problem in clinical medicine Despite much research and development no vaccine for S aureus has been approved
An estimated  to  of the human population are longterm carriers of S aureus which can be found as part of the normal skin flora in the nostrils and as a normal inhabitant of the lower reproductive tract of women S aureus can cause a range of illnesses from minor skin infections such as pimples impetigo boils cellulitis folliculitis carbuncles scalded skin syndrome and abscesses to lifethreatening diseases such as pneumonia meningitis osteomyelitis endocarditis toxic shock syndrome bacteremia and sepsis It is still one of the five most common causes of hospitalacquired infections and is often the cause of wound infections following surgery Each year around  patients in hospitals of the United States contract a staphylococcal infection chiefly by S aureus Up to  deaths each year in the United States are linked with S aureus infections
In  Alexander Ogston a Scottish surgeon discovered that Staphylococcus can cause wound infections after noticing groups of bacteria in pus from a surgical abscess during a procedure he was performing He named it Staphylococcus after its clustered appearance evident under a microscope Then in  German scientist Friedrich Julius Rosenbach identified Staphylococcus aureus discriminating and separating it from Staphylococcus albus a related bacterium In the early s doctors began to use a more streamlined test to detect the presence of an S aureus infection by the means of coagulase testing which enables detection of an enzyme produced by the bacterium Prior to the s S aureus infections were fatal in the majority of patients However doctors discovered that the use of penicillin could cure S aureus infections Unfortunately by the end of the s penicillin resistance became widespread amongst this bacterium population and outbreaks of the resistant strain began to occur
Staphylococcus aureus can be sorted into ten dominant human lineages There are numerous minor lineages as well but these are not seen in the population as often Genomes of bacteria within the same lineage are mostly conserved with the exception of mobile genetic elements Mobile genetic elements that are common in S aureus include bacteriophages pathogenicity islands plasmids transposons and staphylococcal cassette chromosomes These elements have enabled S aureus to continually evolve and gain new traits There is a great deal of genetic variation within the S aureus species A study by Fitzgerald et al  revealed that approximately  of the S aureus genome is noncoding and thus can differ from bacterium to bacterium An example of this difference is seen in the species virulence Only a few strains of S aureus are associated with infections in humans This demonstrates that there is a large range of infectious ability within the species
It has been proposed that one possible reason for the great deal of heterogeneity within the species could be due to its reliance on heterogeneous infections This occurs when multiple different types of S aureus cause an infection within a host The different strains can secrete different enzymes or bring different antibiotic resistances to the group increasing its pathogenic ability Thus there is a need for a large number of mutations and acquisitions of mobile genetic elements
Another notable evolutionary process within the S aureus species is its coevolution with its human hosts Over time this parasitic relationship has led to the bacteriums ability to be carried in the nasopharynx of humans without causing symptoms or infection This allows it to be passed throughout the human population increasing its fitness as a species However only approximately  of the human population are carriers of S aureus with  as continuous carriers and  as intermittent This leads scientists to believe that there are many factors that determine whether S aureus is carried asymptomatically in humans including factors that are specific to an individual person According to a  study by Hofman et al these factors may include age sex diabetes and smoking They also determined some genetic variations in humans that lead to an increased ability for S aureus to colonize notably a polymorphism in the glucocorticoid receptor gene that results in larger corticosteroid production In conclusion there is evidence that any strain of this bacterium can become invasive as this is highly dependent upon human factors
Though S aureus has quick reproductive and microevolutionary rates there are multiple barriers that prevent evolution with the species One such barrier is AGR which is a global accessory gene regulator within the bacteria This such regulator has been linked to the virulence level of the bacteria Loss of function mutations within this gene have been found to increase the fitness of the bacterium containing it Thus S aureus must make a tradeoff to increase their success as a species exchanging reduced virulence for increased drug resistance Another barrier to evolution is the Sau Type I restriction modification RM system This system exists to protect the bacterium from foreign DNA by digesting it Exchange of DNA between the same lineage is not blocked since they have the same enzymes and the RM system does not recognize the new DNA as foreign but transfer between different lineages is blocked
S aureus ˌstæfɪləˈkɒkəs ˈɔːriəs loʊ Greek σταφυλόκοκκος "grapecluster berry" Latin aureus "golden" is a facultative aerobic Grampositive coccal round bacterium also known as "golden staph" and "oro staphira" S aureus is nonmotile and does not form spores In medical literature the bacterium is often referred to as S aureus Staph aureus or Staph a S aureus  appears as staphylococci grapelike clusters when viewed through a microscope and has large round goldenyellow colonies often with hemolysis when grown on blood agar plates S aureus reproduces asexually by binary fission  Complete separation of the daughter cells is mediated by S aureus autolysin and in its absence or targeted inhibition the daughter cells remain attached to one another and appear as clusters
S aureus is catalasepositive meaning it can produce the enzyme catalase Catalase converts hydrogen peroxide HO to water and oxygen Catalaseactivity tests are sometimes used to distinguish staphylococci from enterococci and streptococci  Previously S aureus was differentiated from other staphylococci by the coagulase test However not all S aureus strains are coagulasepositive and incorrect species identification can impact effective treatment and control measures
Staphylococcus is different from the similarly named and medically relevant genus Streptococcus
Natural genetic transformation is a reproductive process involving DNA transfer from one bacterium to another through the intervening medium and the integration of the donor sequence into the recipient genome by homologous recombination  S aureus was found to be capable of natural genetic transformation but only at low frequency under the experimental conditions employed Further studies suggested that the development of competence for natural genetic transformation may be substantially higher under appropriate conditions yet to be discovered
In humans S aureus can be present in the upper respiratory tract gut mucosa and skin as a member of the normal microbiota However because S aureus can cause disease under certain host and environmental conditions it is characterized as a "pathobiont"
While S aureus usually acts as a commensal bacterium asymptomatically colonizing about  of the human population it can sometimes cause disease In particular S aureus is one of the most common causes of bacteremia and infective endocarditis Additionally it can cause various skin and softtissue infections particularly when skin or mucosal barriers have been breached
S aureus infections can spread through contact with pus from an infected wound skintoskin contact with an infected person and contact with objects used by an infected person such as towels sheets clothing or athletic equipment Joint replacements put a person at particular risk of septic arthritis staphylococcal endocarditis infection of the heart valves and pneumonia
Preventive measures include washing hands often with soap and making sure to bathe or shower daily
S aureus is a significant cause of chronic biofilm infections on medical implants and the repressor of toxins is part of the infection pathway
S aureus can lay dormant in the body for years undetected  Once symptoms begin to show the host is contagious for another two weeks and the overall illness lasts a few weeks If untreated though the disease can be deadly Deeply penetrating S aureus infections can be severe
Skin infections are the most common form of S aureus infection This can manifest in various ways including small benign boils folliculitis impetigo cellulitis and more severe invasive softtissue infections
S aureus is extremely prevalent in persons with atopic dermatitis more commonly known as eczema It is mostly found in fertile active places including the armpits hair and scalp  Large pimples that appear in those areas may exacerbate the infection if lacerated This can lead to staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome a severe form of which can be seen in newborns
The presence of S aureus in persons with atopic dermatitis is not an indication to treat with oral antibiotics as evidence has not shown this to give benefit to the patient However topical antibiotics combined with corticosteroids have been found to improve the condition Colonization of S aureus drives inflammation of atopic dermatitis S aureus is believed to exploit defects in the skin barrier of persons with atopic dermatitis triggering cytokine expression and therefore exacerbating symptoms
S aureus is also responsible for food poisoning and achieves this by generating toxins in the human body Its incubation period lasts one to six hours with the illness itself lasting from  minutes to  days
Preventive measures one can take to help prevent the spread of the disease include washing hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing food Stay away from any food if ill and wear gloves if any open wounds occur on hands or wrists while preparing food If storing food for longer than  hours keep the food below  or above  °F  or  °C
S aureus is the bacterium commonly responsible for all major bone and joint infections This manifests in one of three forms osteomyelitis septic arthritis and infection from a replacement joint surgery
S aureus is a leading cause of bloodstream infections throughout much of the industrialized world Infection is generally associated with breaks in the skin or mucosal membranes due to surgery injury or use of intravascular devices such as catheters hemodialysis machines or injected drugs Once the bacteria have entered the bloodstream they can infect various organs causing infective endocarditis septic arthritis and osteomyelitis This disease is particularly prevalent and severe in the very young and very old
Without antibiotic treatment S aureus bacteremia has a case fatality rate around  With antibiotic treatment case fatality rates range from  to  depending on the age and health of the patient as well as the antibiotic resistance of the S aureus strain
S aureus is often found in biofilms formed on medical devices implanted in the body or on human tissue It is commonly found with another pathogen Candida albicans forming multispecies biofilms  The latter is suspected to help S aureus penetrate human tissue A higher mortality is linked with multispecies biofilms
S aureus biofilm is the predominant cause of orthopedic implantrelated infections but is also found on cardiac implants vascular grafts various catheters and cosmetic surgical implants After implantation the surface of these devices becomes coated with host proteins which provide a rich surface for bacterial attachment and biofilm formation Once the device becomes infected it must by completely removed since S aureus biofilm cannot be destroyed by antibiotic treatments
Current therapy for S aureus biofilmmediated infections involves surgical removal of the infected device followed by antibiotic treatment Conventional antibiotic treatment alone is not effective in eradicating such infections An alternative to postsurgical antibiotic treatment is using antibioticloaded dissolvable calcium sulfate beads which are implanted with the medical device These beads can release high doses of antibiotics at the desired site to prevent the initial infection
Novel treatments for S aureus biofilm involving nano silver particles bacteriophages and plantderived antibiotic agents are being studied These agents have shown inhibitory effects against S aureus embedded in biofilms A class of enzymes have been found to have biofilm matrixdegrading ability thus may be used as biofilm dispersal agents in combination with antibiotics
S aureus can survive on dogs cats and horses and can cause bumblefoot in chickens Some believe healthcare workers dogs should be considered a significant source of antibioticresistant S aureus especially in times of outbreak In a  study by Boost ODonoghue and James it was found that just about  of S aureus colonized within pet dogs presented as resistant to at least one antibiotic The nasal region has been implicated as the most important site of transfer between dogs and humans
S aureus is one of the causal agents of mastitis in dairy cows Its large polysaccharide capsule protects the organism from recognition by the cows immune defenses
S aureus produces various enzymes such as coagulase bound and free coagulases which facilitates the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin to cause clots which is important in skin infections
Hyaluronidase also known as spreading factor breaks down hyaluronic acid and helps in spreading it Deoxyribonuclease which breaks down the DNA protects S aureus from neutrophil extracellular trapmediated killing S aureus also produces lipase to digest lipids staphylokinase to dissolve fibrin and aid in spread and betalactamase for drug resistance
Depending on the strain S aureus is capable of secreting several exotoxins which can be categorized into three groups  Many of these toxins are associated with specific diseases

A secretion system is a highly specialised multiprotein unit that is embedded in the cell envelope with the function of translocating effector proteins from inside of the cell to the extracellular space or into a target host cytosol The exact structure and function of TSS is yet to be fully elucidated Currently four proteins are known components of S aureus Type VII Secretion System TSS EssC is a large integral membrane ATPase  which most likely powers the secretion systems and has been hypothesised forming part of the translocation channel The other proteins are EsaA EssB EssA that are membrane proteins that function alongside EssC to mediate protein secretion The exact mechanism of how substrates reach the cell surface is unknown as is the interaction of the three membrane proteins with each other and EssC 
T depedent effector proteins
EsaD is DNA endonuclease toxin secreted by S aureus has been shown to inhibit growth of competitor S aureus strain in vitro EsaD is cosecreted with chaperone EsaE which stabilises EsaD structure and brings EsaD to EssC for secretion Strains that produce EsaD also coproduce EsaG a cytoplasmic antitoxin that protects the producer strain from EsaDs toxicity
TspA is another toxin that mediates intraspecies competition It is a bacteriostatic toxin that has a membrane depolarising activity facilitated by its cterminal domain Tsai is a transmembrane protein that confers immunity to the producer strain of TspA as well as the attacked strains There is genetic variability of the cterminal domain of TspA therefore it seems like the strains may produce different TspA variants to increase competitiveness
Toxins that play a role in intraspecies competition confers an advantage by promoting successful colonisation in polymicrobial communities such as the nasopharynx and lung by outcompeting lesser strains  
There are also T effector proteins that play role a in pathogenesis for example mutational studies of S aureus have suggested that EsxB and EsxC contribute to persistent infection in a murine abscess model  
EsxX is has been implicated in neutrophil lysis therefore suggested as contributing to the evasion of host immune system Deletion of essX in S aureus resulted in significantly reduced resistance to neutrophils and reduced virulence in murine skin and blood infection models
Altogether TSS and known secreted effector proteins are a strategy of pathogenesis by improving fitness against competitor S aureus species as well as increased virulence via evading the innate immune system and optimising persistent infections
The list of small RNAs involved in the control of bacterial virulence in S aureus is growing This can be facilitated by factors such as increased biofilm formation in the presence of increased levels of such small RNAs For example RNAIII SprD SprC RsaE SprA SSR ArtR SprX and Teg
Many mRNAs in S aureus carry three prime untranslated regions UTR longer than  nucleotides which may potentially have a regulatory function
Further investigation of icaR mRNA mRNA coding for the repressor of the main expolysaccharidic compound of the bacteria biofilm matrix demonstrated that the UTR binding to the  UTR can interfere with the translation initiation complex and generate a double stranded substrate for RNase III The interaction is between the UCCCCUG motif in the UTR and the ShineDalagarno region at the UTR Deletion of the motif resulted in IcaR repressor accumulation and inhibition of biofilm development The biofilm formation is the main cause of Staphylococcus implant infections
Biofilms are groups of microorganisms such as bacteria that attach to each other and grow on wet surfaces The S aureus biofilm is embedded in a glycocalyx slime layer and can consist of teichoic acids host proteins extracellular DNA eDNA and polysaccharide intercellular antigen PIA Not all S aureus biofilms contain PIA S aureus biofilms are important in disease pathogenesis as they can contribute to antibiotic resistance and immune system evasion S aureus biofilm has high resistance to antibiotic treatments and host immune response One hypothesis for explaining this is that the biofilm matrix protects the embedded cells by acting as a barrier to prevent antibiotic penetration However the biofilm matrix is composed with many water channels so this hypothesis is becoming increasingly less likely but a biofilm matrix possibly contains antibiotic‐degrading enzymes such as βlactamases which can prevent antibiotic penetration Another hypothesis is that the conditions in the biofilm matrix favor the formation of persister cells which are highly antibioticresistant dormant bacterial cells S aureus biofilms also have high resistance to host immune response Though the exact mechanism of resistance is unknown S aureus biofilms have increased growth under the presence of cytokines produced by the host immune response Host antibodies are less effective for S aureus biofilm due to the heterogeneous antigen distribution where an antigen may be present in some areas of the biofilm but completely absent from other areas
Studies in biofilm development have shown to be related to changes in gene expression There are specific genes that were found to be crucial in the different biofilm growth stages Two of these genes include rocD and gudB which encode for the enzymes ornithineoxoacid transaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase which are important for amino acid metabolism Studies have shown biofilm development rely on amino acids glutamine and glutamate for proper metabolic functions
Protein A is anchored to staphylococcal peptidoglycan pentaglycine bridges chains of five glycine residues by the transpeptidase sortase A Protein A an IgGbinding protein binds to the Fc region of an antibody  In fact studies involving mutation of genes coding for protein A resulted in a lowered virulence of S aureus as measured by survival in blood which has led to speculation that protein Acontributed virulence requires binding of antibody Fc regions
Protein A in various recombinant forms has been used for decades to bind and purify a wide range of antibodies by immunoaffinity chromatography  Transpeptidases such as the sortases responsible for anchoring factors like protein A to the staphylococcal peptidoglycan are being studied in hopes of developing new antibiotics to target MRSA infections
Some strains of S aureus are capable of producing staphyloxanthin  a goldencoloured carotenoid pigment  This pigment acts as a virulence factor primarily by being a bacterial antioxidant which helps the microbe evade the reactive oxygen species which the host immune system uses to kill pathogens
Mutant strains of S aureus modified to lack staphyloxanthin are less likely to survive incubation with an oxidizing chemical such as hydrogen peroxide than pigmented strains Mutant colonies are quickly killed when exposed to human neutrophils while many of the pigmented colonies survive In mice the pigmented strains cause lingering abscesses when inoculated into wounds whereas wounds infected with the unpigmented strains quickly heal
These tests suggest the Staphylococcus strains use staphyloxanthin as a defence against the normal human immune system  Drugs designed to inhibit the production of staphyloxanthin may weaken the bacterium and renew its susceptibility to antibiotics In fact because of similarities in the pathways for biosynthesis of staphyloxanthin and human cholesterol a drug developed in the context of cholesterollowering therapy was shown to block S aureus pigmentation and disease progression in a mouse infection model
Depending upon the type of infection present an appropriate specimen is obtained accordingly and sent to the laboratory for definitive identification by using biochemical or enzymebased tests A Gram stain is first performed to guide the way which should show typical Grampositive bacteria cocci in clusters Second the isolate is cultured on mannitol salt agar which is a selective medium with  NaCl that allows S aureus to grow producing yellowcolored colonies as a result of mannitol fermentation and subsequent drop in the mediums pH
Furthermore for differentiation on the species level catalase positive for all Staphylococcus species coagulase fibrin clot formation positive for S aureus DNAse zone of clearance on DNase agar lipase a yellow color and rancid odor smell and phosphatase a pink color tests are all done For staphylococcal food poisoning phage typing can be performed to determine whether the staphylococci recovered from the food were the source of infection
Recent activities and food that a patient has recently eaten will be inquired about by a physician and a physical examination is conducted to review any symptoms With more severe symptoms blood tests and stool culture may be in order
Diagnostic microbiology laboratories and reference laboratories are key for identifying outbreaks and new strains of S aureus Recent genetic advances have enabled reliable and rapid techniques for the identification and characterization of clinical isolates of S aureus in real time These tools support infection control strategies to limit bacterial spread and ensure the appropriate use of antibiotics Quantitative PCR is increasingly being used to identify outbreaks of infection
When observing the evolvement of S aureus and its ability to adapt to each modified antibiotic two basic methods known as "bandbased" or "sequencebased" are employed Keeping these two methods in mind other methods such as multilocus sequence typing MLST pulsedfield gel electrophoresis PFGE bacteriophage typing spa locus typing and SCCmec typing are often conducted more than others With these methods it can be determined where strains of MRSA originated and also where they are currently 	
With MLST this technique of typing uses fragments of several housekeeping genes known as aroE glpF gmk pta tip and yqiL These sequences are then assigned a number which give to a string of several numbers that serve as the allelic profile Although this is a common method a limitation about this method is the maintenance of the microarray which detects newly allelic profiles making it a costly and timeconsuming experiment
With PFGE a method which is still very much used dating back to its first success in s remains capable of helping differentiate MRSA isolates To accomplish this the technique uses multiple gel electrophoresis along with a voltage gradient to display clear resolutions of molecules The S aureus fragments then transition down the gel producing specific band patterns that are later compared with other isolates in hopes of identifying related strains Limitations of the method include practical difficulties with uniform band patterns and PFGE sensitivity as a whole
Spa locus typing is also considered a popular technique that uses a single locus zone in a polymorphic region of S aureus to distinguish any form of mutations Although this technique is often inexpensive and less timeconsuming the chance of losing discriminatory power making it hard to differentiate between MLST clonal complexes exemplifies a crucial limitation
For susceptible strains the treatment of choice for S aureus infection is penicillin An antibiotic derived from some Penicillium fungal species penicillin inhibits the formation of peptidoglycan crosslinkages that provide the rigidity and strength in a bacterial cell wall The fourmembered βlactam ring of penicillin is bound to enzyme DDtranspeptidase an enzyme that when functional crosslinks chains of peptidoglycan that form bacterial cell walls The binding of βlactam to DDtranspeptidase inhibits the enzymes functionality and it can no longer catalyze the formation of the crosslinks As a result cell wall formation and degradation are imbalanced thus resulting in cell death In most countries however penicillin resistance is extremely common  and firstline therapy is most commonly a penicillinaseresistant βlactam antibiotic for example oxacillin or flucloxacillin both of which have the same mechanism of action as penicillin or vancomycin depending on local resistance patterns Combination therapy with gentamicin may be used to treat serious infections such as endocarditis but its use is controversial because of the high risk of damage to the kidneys The duration of treatment depends on the site of infection and on severity Adjunctive rifampicin has been historically used in the management of S aureus bacteraemia but randomised controlled trial evidence has shown this to be of no overall benefit over standard antibiotic therapy
Antibiotic resistance in S aureus was uncommon when penicillin was first introduced in  Indeed the original Petri dish on which Alexander Fleming of Imperial College London observed the antibacterial activity of the Penicillium fungus was growing a culture of S aureus By   of hospital S aureus isolates were penicillinresistant by  this had risen to 
Methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA often pronounced ˈmɜːrsə or ɛm ɑːr ɛs eɪ is one of a number of greatly feared strains of S aureus which have become resistant to most βlactam antibiotics For this reason vancomycin a glycopeptide antibiotic is commonly used to combat MRSA Vancomycin inhibits the synthesis of peptidoglycan but unlike βlactam antibiotics glycopeptide antibiotics target and bind to amino acids in the cell wall preventing peptidoglycan crosslinkages from forming MRSA strains are most often found associated with institutions such as hospitals but are becoming increasingly prevalent in communityacquired infections
Minor skin infections can be treated with triple antibiotic ointment One topical agent that is prescribed is Mupirocin a protein synthesis inhibitor that is produced naturally by Pseudomonas fluorescens and has seen success for treatment of S aureus nasal carriage
S aureus was found to be the second leading pathogen for deaths associated with Antimicrobial resistance in 
Staphylococcal resistance to penicillin is mediated by penicillinase a form of betalactamase production an enzyme that cleaves the βlactam ring of the penicillin molecule rendering the antibiotic ineffective Penicillinaseresistant βlactam antibiotics such as methicillin nafcillin oxacillin cloxacillin dicloxacillin and flucloxacillin are able to resist degradation by staphylococcal penicillinase
Resistance to methicillin is mediated via the mec operon part of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec SCCmec SCCmec is a family of mobile genetic elements which is a major driving force of S aureus evolution Resistance is conferred by the mecA gene which codes for an altered penicillinbinding protein PBPa or PBP that has a lower affinity for binding βlactams penicillins cephalosporins and carbapenems This allows for resistance to all βlactam antibiotics and obviates their clinical use during MRSA infections Studies have explained that this mobile genetic element has been acquired by different lineages in separate gene transfer events indicating that there is not a common ancestor of differing MRSA strains Interestingly one study suggests that MRSA sacrifices virulence for example toxin production and invasiveness for survival and creation of biofilms
Aminoglycoside antibiotics such as kanamycin gentamicin streptomycin were once effective against staphylococcal infections until strains evolved mechanisms to inhibit the aminoglycosides action which occurs via protonated amine andor hydroxyl interactions with the ribosomal RNA of the bacterial S ribosomal subunit Three main mechanisms of aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms are currently and widely accepted aminoglycoside modifying enzymes ribosomal mutations and active efflux of the drug out of the bacteria
Aminoglycosidemodifying enzymes inactivate the aminoglycoside by covalently attaching either a phosphate nucleotide or acetyl moiety to either the amine or the alcohol key functional group or both groups of the antibiotic  This changes the charge or sterically hinders the antibiotic decreasing its ribosomal binding affinity  In S aureus the bestcharacterized aminoglycosidemodifying enzyme is aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase  IA ANTIA  This enzyme has been solved by Xray crystallography The enzyme is able to attach an adenyl moiety to the  hydroxyl group of many aminoglycosides including kamamycin and gentamicin
Glycopeptide resistance is mediated by acquisition of the vanA gene which originates from the Tn transposon found in a plasmid in enterococci and codes for an enzyme that produces an alternative peptidoglycan to which vancomycin will not bind
Today S aureus has become resistant to many commonly used antibiotics  In the UK only  of all S aureus isolates are sensitive to penicillin with a similar picture in the rest of the world The βlactamaseresistant penicillins methicillin oxacillin cloxacillin and flucloxacillin were developed to treat penicillinresistant S aureus and are still used as firstline treatment  Methicillin was the first antibiotic in this class to be used it was introduced in  but only two years later the first case of methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA was reported in England
Despite this MRSA generally remained an uncommon finding even in hospital settings until the s when the MRSA prevalence in hospitals exploded and it is now endemic Now methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA is not only a human pathogen causing a variety of infections such as skin and soft tissue infection SSTI pneumonia and sepsis but it also can cause disease in animals known as livestockassociated MRSA LAMRSA
MRSA infections in both the hospital and community setting are commonly treated with nonβlactam antibiotics such as clindamycin a lincosamine and cotrimoxazole also commonly known as trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole  Resistance to these antibiotics has also led to the use of new broadspectrum antiGrampositive antibiotics such as linezolid because of its availability as an oral drug Firstline treatment for serious invasive infections due to MRSA is currently glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin  A number of problems with these antibiotics occur such as the need for intravenous administration no oral preparation is available toxicity and the need to monitor drug levels regularly by blood tests  Also glycopeptide antibiotics do not penetrate very well into infected tissues this is a particular concern with infections of the brain and meninges and in endocarditis  Glycopeptides must not be used to treat methicillinsensitive S aureus MSSA as outcomes are inferior
Because of the high level of resistance to penicillins and because of the potential for MRSA to develop resistance to vancomycin the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published guidelines for the appropriate use of vancomycin In situations where the incidence of MRSA infections is known to be high the attending physician may choose to use a glycopeptide antibiotic until the identity of the infecting organism is known  After the infection is confirmed to be due to a methicillinsusceptible strain of S aureus treatment can be changed to flucloxacillin or even penicillin as appropriate
Vancomycinresistant S aureus VRSA is a strain of S aureus that has become resistant to the glycopeptides The first case of vancomycinintermediate S aureus VISA was reported in Japan in  but the first case of S aureus truly resistant to glycopeptide antibiotics was only reported in  Three cases of VRSA infection had been reported in the United States as of  At least in part the antimicrobial resistance in S aureus can be explained by its ability to adapt Multiple two component signal transduction pathways helps S aureus to express genes that are required to survive under antimicrobial stress
About   of the US population are carriers of S aureus and about  carry MRSA Even healthcare providers can be MRSA colonizers
The carriage of S aureus is an important source of hospitalacquired infection also called nosocomial and communityacquired MRSA  Although S aureus can be present on the skin of the host a large proportion of its carriage is through the anterior nares of the nasal passages and can further be present in the ears The ability of the nasal passages to harbour  S aureus results from a combination of a weakened or defective host immunity and the bacteriums ability to evade host innate immunity Nasal carriage is also implicated in the occurrence of staph infections
Spread of S aureus including MRSA generally is through humantohuman contact although recently some veterinarians have discovered the infection can be spread through pets with environmental contamination thought to play a relatively less important part  Emphasis on basic hand washing techniques are therefore effective in preventing its transmission The use of disposable aprons and gloves by staff reduces skintoskin contact so further reduces the risk of transmission
Recently myriad cases of S aureus have been reported in hospitals across America Transmission of the pathogen is facilitated in medical settings where healthcare worker hygiene is insufficient S aureus is an incredibly hardy bacterium as was shown in a study where it survived on polyester for just under three months polyester is the main material used in hospital privacy curtains
The bacteria are transported on the hands of healthcare workers who may pick them up from a seemingly healthy patient carrying a benign or commensal strain of S aureus and then pass it on to the next patient being treated  Introduction of the bacteria into the bloodstream can lead to various complications including endocarditis meningitis and if it is widespread sepsis
Ethanol has proven to be an effective topical sanitizer against MRSA Quaternary ammonium can be used in conjunction with ethanol to increase the duration of the sanitizing action The prevention of nosocomial infections involves routine and terminal cleaning Nonflammable alcohol vapor in CO NAVCO systems have an advantage as they do not attack metals or plastics used in medical environments and do not contribute to antibacterial resistance
An important and previously unrecognized means of communityassociated MRSA colonization and transmission is during sexual contact
S aureus is killed in one minute at  °C and in ten minutes at  °C but is resistant to freezing
Certain strains of S aureus have been described as being resistant to chlorine disinfection
The use of mupirocin ointment can reduce the  rate of infections due to nasal carriage of S aureus There is limited evidence that nasal decontamination of S aureus using antibiotics or antiseptics can reduce the rates of surgical site infections
As of  no approved vaccine exists against S aureus Early clinical trials have been conducted for several vaccines candidates such as Nabis StaphVax and PentaStaph Intercells  Mercks V VRis SA and others
While some of these vaccines candidates have shown immune responses others aggravated an infection by S aureus To date none of these candidates provides protection against a S aureus infection The development of Nabis StaphVax was stopped in  after phase III trials failed Intercells first V vaccine variant was terminated during phase IIIII after higher mortality and morbidity were observed among patients who developed S aureus infection
Nabis enhanced S aureus vaccines candidate PentaStaph was sold in  to GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA The current status of PentaStaph is unclear A WHO document indicates that PentaStaph failed in the phase III trial stage
In  GlaxoSmithKline started a phase  blind study to evaluate its GSKA vaccine As of  this vaccine is no longer under active development
Pfizers S aureus fourantigen vaccine SAAg was granted fast track designation by the US Food and Drug Administration  in February  In  Pfizer has commenced a phase b trial regarding the SAAg vaccine Phase  results published in February  showed a very robust and secure immunogenicity of SAAg The vaccine underwent clinical trial until June  with results published in September  that did not demonstrate a significant reduction in Postoperative Bloodstream Infection after Surgery
In  Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics a former division of Novartis and now part of GlaxoSmithKline published promising preclinical results of their fourcomponent Staphylococcus aureus vaccine Cstaph
In  essential oil extracted by hydrodistillation from the leaves of Myrciaria pilosa was found to have potential as an antimicrobial drug to control infection by multiresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus
A number of standard strains of S aureus called "type cultures" are used in research and in laboratory testing
