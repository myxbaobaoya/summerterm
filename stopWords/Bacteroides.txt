Bacteroides genus Gramnegative, obligate anaerobic bacteria. Bacteroides species non endosporeforming bacilli, may either motile nonmotile, depending species. The DNA base composition – GC. Unusual bacterial organisms, Bacteroides membranes contain sphingolipids. They also contain mesodiaminopimelic acid peptidoglycan layer. Bacteroides species normally mutualistic, making substantial portion mammalian gastrointestinal microbiota, play fundamental role processing complex molecules simpler ones host intestine. As many – cells per gram human feces reported. They use simple sugars available; however, main sources energy Bacteroides species gut complex hostderived plant glycans. Studies indicate longterm diet strongly associated gut microbiome compositionthose eat plenty protein animal fats predominantly Bacteroides bacteria, consume carbohydrates Prevotella species dominate. One important clinically Bacteroides fragilis. Bacteroides melaninogenicus recently reclassified split Prevotella melaninogenica Prevotella intermedia. Bacteroides species also benefit host excluding potential pathogens colonizing gut. Some species B. fragilis, example opportunistic human pathogens, causing infections peritoneal cavity, gastrointestinal surgery, appendicitis via abscess formation, inhibiting phagocytosis, inactivating betalactam antibiotics. Although Bacteroides species anaerobic, transiently aerotolerant thus survive abdominal cavity. In general, Bacteroides resistant wide variety antibioticsβlactams, aminoglycosides, recently many species acquired resistance erythromycin tetracycline. This high level antibiotic resistance prompted concerns Bacteroides species may become reservoir resistance other, highly pathogenic bacterial strains. It often considered susceptible clindamycin, recent evidence demonstrated increasing trend clindamycin resistance rates . An alternative fecal indicator organism, Bacteroides, suggested make significant portion fecal bacterial population, high degree host specificity reflects differences digestive system host animal Over past decade, realtime polymerase chain reaction PCR methods used detect presence various microbial pathogens amplification specific DNA sequences without culturing bacteria. One study measured amount Bacteroides using qPCR quantify hostspecific S rRNA genetic marker. This technique allows quantification genetic markers specific host bacteria Bacteroides allow detection recent contamination. A recent report found temperature plays major role amount time bacteria persist environment, life span increases colder temperatures – °C. Early research suggests affects brain development. "A new study found threeway relationship type gut bacteria, cortisol, brain metabolites. This relationship, researchers hypothesize, may potentially lead insight autism, indepth studies needed." Another study showed .times higher risk osteoporosis fractures low Bacteroides group Japanese postmenopausal women. Members Bacillota Bacteroidota phyla make majority bacterial species human intestinal microbiota "gut microbiome". The healthy human gut microbiome consists abundant species . members Bacteroidetes belong Bacillota Actinomycetota. Bacteroides species' main source energy fermentation wide range sugar derivatives plant material. These compounds common human colon potentially toxic. Bacteroides Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron converts sugars fermentation products beneficial humans. Bacteroides also ability remove side chains bile acids, thus returning bile acids hepatic circulation. There data suggesting members Bacteroides affect lean obese phenotype humans. In article, one human twin obese lean. When fecal microbiota transplanted germfree mice, phenotype mouse model corresponds humans.
