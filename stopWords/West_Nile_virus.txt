West Nile virus WNV singlestranded RNA virus causes West Nile fever It member family Flaviviridae genus Flavivirus also contains Zika virus dengue virus yellow fever virus The virus primarily transmitted mosquitoes mostly species Culex The primary hosts WNV birds virus remains within "bird–mosquito–bird" transmission cycle The virus genetically related Japanese encephalitis family viruses Humans horses exhibit disease symptoms virus symptoms rarely occur animals Identification human disease first made Uganda latter half th century spread many parts world Like flaviviruses WNV enveloped virus icosahedral symmetry Electron microscope studies reveal – nm virion covered relatively smooth protein shell structure similar dengue fever virus another Flavivirus The protein shell made two structural proteins glycoprotein E small membrane protein M Protein E numerous functions including receptor binding viral attachment entry cell membrane fusion The outer protein shell covered hostderived lipid membrane viral envelope The flavivirus lipid membrane found contain cholesterol phosphatidylserine elements membrane yet identified The lipid membrane many roles viral infection

Once WNV successfully entered bloodstream host animal envelope protein E binds attachment factors called glycosaminoglycans host cell These attachment factors aid entry cell however binding primary receptors also necessary Primary receptors include DCSIGN DCSIGNR integrin αvβ By binding primary receptors WNV enters cell clathrinmediated endocytosis As result endocytosis WNV enters cell within

endemic Oceania A fatal case killer whale Texas broadened known host range West Nile virus include cetaceans Since first North American cases virus reported throughout United States Canada Mexico Caribbean Central America There human cases equine cases many birds infected The Barbary macaque Macaca sylvanus first nonhuman primate contract WNV Both American Israeli strains marked high mortality rates infected avian populations presence dead birdsespecially Corvidaecan early indicator arrival virus The natural hosts WNV birds mosquitoes Over different species bird shown infected virus Some birds including American crow Corvus brachyrhynchos blue jay Cyanocitta cristata greater sagegrouse Centrocercus urophasianus killed infection others survive The American robin Turdus migratorius house sparrow Passer domesticus thought among important reservoir species N American European cities Brown thrashers Toxostoma rufum gray catbirds Dumetella carolinensis northern cardinals Cardinalis cardinalis northern mockingbirds Mimus polyglottos wood thrushes Hylocichla mustelina dove family among common N American birds high levels antibodies WNV found WNV demonstrated large number mosquito species significant viral transmission Culex species feed birds including Culex pipiens C restuans C salinarius C quinquefasciatus C nigripalpus C erraticus C tarsalis Experimental infection also demonstrated soft tick vectors unlikely important natural transmission WNV broad host range also known able infect least mammalian species including humans nonhuman primates horses dogs cats Some infected humans horses experience disease dogs cats rarely show symptoms Reptiles amphibians also infected including species crocodiles alligators snakes lizards frogs Mammals considered incidental deadend hosts virus usually develop high enough level virus blood viremia infect another mosquito feeding carry transmission cycle birds also deadend hosts In normal rural enzootic transmission cycle virus alternates bird reservoir mosquito vector It also transmitted birds via direct contact eating infected bird carcass drinking infected water Vertical transmission female offspring possible mosquitoes might potentially important overwintering In urban spillover cycle infected mosquitoes fed infected birds transmit virus humans This requires mosquito species bite birds humans termed bridge vectors The virus also rarely spread blood transfusions organ transplants mother baby pregnancy delivery breastfeeding Unlike birds otherwise spread directly people West Nile fever infection West Nile virus typically spread mosquitoes In infections people symptoms About people develop fever headache vomiting rash In less people encephalitis meningitis occurs associated neck stiffness confusion seizures Recovery may take weeks months The risk death among nervous system affected percent West Nile virus WNV usually spread mosquitoes become infected feed infected birds often carry disease Rarely virus spread blood transfusions organ transplants mother baby pregnancy delivery breastfeeding otherwise spread directly people Risks severe disease include years old health problems Diagnosis typically based symptoms blood tests There human vaccine The best way reduce risk infection avoid mosquito bites Mosquito populations may reduced eliminating standing pools water old tires buckets gutters swimming pools When mosquitoes cannot avoided mosquito repellent window screens mosquito nets reduce likelihood bitten There specific treatment disease pain medications may reduce symptoms Severe disease may also occur horses Several vaccines animals available Before availability veterinary vaccines around horses infected North America died According Center Disease Control infection West Nile Virus seasonal temperate zones Climates temperate United States Europe see peak season July October Peak season changes depending geographic region warmer humid climates see longer peak seasons All ages equally likely infected higher amount death neuroinvasive West Nile Virus people – years old People older age likely adverse effects There several modes transmission common cause infection humans bitten infected mosquito Other modes transmission include blood transfusion organ transplantation breastfeeding transplacental transmission laboratory acquisition These alternative modes transmission extremely rare Prevention efforts WNV mainly focus preventing human contact bitten infected mosquitoes This twofold first personal protective actions second mosquitocontrol actions When person area WNV important avoid outdoor activity go outside use mosquito repellent DEET A person also wear clothing covers skin long sleeves pants Mosquito control done community level include surveillance programs control programs including pesticides reducing mosquito habitats This includes draining standing water Surveillance systems birds particularly useful If dead birds found neighborhood event reported local authorities This may help health departments surveillance determine birds infected West Nile Virus Despite commercial availability four veterinary vaccines horses human vaccine progressed beyond phase II clinical trials Efforts made produce vaccine human use several candidates produced none licensed use The best method reduce risk infections avoiding mosquito bites This may done eliminating standing pools water old tires buckets gutters swimming pools Mosquito repellent window screens mosquito nets avoiding areas mosquitoes occur may also useful Like tropical diseases expected increased spread due climate change concern changing weather conditions increase West Nile Virus spread Climate change affect disease rates ranges seasonality affects distribution West Nile Virus Projected changes flood frequency severity bring new challenges flood risk management allowing increased mosquito populations urban areas Weather conditions affected climate change including temperature precipitation wind may affect survival reproduction rates mosquitoes suitable habitats distribution abundance Ambient temperatures drive mosquito replication rates transmission WNV affecting peak season mosquitoes geographic variations For example increased temperatures affect rate virus replication speed virus evolution rate viral transmission efficiency Furthermore higher winter temperatures warmer spring may lead larger summer mosquito populations increasing risk WNV Similarly rainfall may also drive mosquito replication rates affect seasonality geographic variations virus Studies show association heavy precipitation higher incidence reported WNV Likewise wind another environmental factor serves dispersal mechanism mosquitoes Mosquitoes extremely wide environmental tolerances nearly ubiquitous geographical distribution present major land masses except Antarctica Iceland Nevertheless changes climate land use ecological timescales variously expand fragment distribution patterns raising consequent concerns human health
