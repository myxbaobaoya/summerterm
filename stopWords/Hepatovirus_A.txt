Hepatitis A infectious disease liver caused Hepatovirus A HAV type viral hepatitis Many cases symptoms especially young The time infection symptoms develop – weeks When symptoms occur typically last weeks may include nausea vomiting diarrhea jaundice fever abdominal pain Around – people experience recurrence symptoms months initial infection Acute liver failure may rarely occur common elderly It usually spread eating food drinking water contaminated infected feces Undercooked raw shellfish relatively common sources It may also spread close contact infectious person While children often symptoms infected still able infect others After single infection person immune rest life Diagnosis requires blood testing symptoms similar number diseases It one five known hepatitis viruses A B C D E The hepatitis A vaccine effective preventionneeds update Some countries recommend routinely children higher risk previously vaccinated It appears effective life Other preventive measures include hand washing properly cooking food No specific treatment available rest medications nausea diarrhea recommended asneeded basis Infections usually resolve completely without ongoing liver disease Treatment acute liver failure occurs liver transplantation Globally around million symptomatic cases occur year million infections symptomatic asymptomatic It common regions world poor sanitation enough safe water In developing world children infected age thus immune adulthood It often occurs outbreaks moderately developed countries children exposed young vaccination widespread Acute hepatitis A resulted deaths World Hepatitis Day occurs year July bring awareness viral hepatitis Early symptoms hepatovirus A infection mistaken influenza sufferers especially children exhibit symptoms Symptoms typically appear – weeks incubation period initial infection About children symptoms The time infection symptoms develop – weeks average days The risk symptomatic infection directly related age adults symptoms compatible acute viral hepatitis majority children either asymptomatic unrecognized infections Symptoms usually last less months although people ill long months Joint pains red cell aplasia pancreatitis generalized lymphadenopathy possible extrahepatic manifestations Kidney failure pericarditis uncommon If occur show acute onset disappear upon resolution diseasecitation needed Hepatovirus A species virus order Picornavirales family Picornaviridae genus Hepatovirus Humans vertebrates serve natural hosts Nine members Hepatovirus recognized These species infect bats rodents hedgehogs shrews Phylogenetic analysis suggests rodent origin Hepatitis A A member virus hepatovirus B Phopivirus isolated seal This virus shared common ancestor Hepatovirus A years agocitation needed Another hepatovirus – Marmota himalayana hepatovirus – isolated woodchuck Marmota himalayana This virus appears common ancestor primateinfecting species around years agocitation needed One serotype seven different genetic groups four human three simian described The human genotypes numbered I–III Six subtypes described IA IB IIA IIB IIIA IIIB The simian genotypes numbered IV–VI A single isolate genotype VII isolated human also described Genotype III isolated humans owl monkeys Most human isolates genotype I Of type I isolates subtype IA accounts majority The mutation rate genome estimated – × − nucleotide substitutions per site per year The human strains appear diverged simian years ago The mean age genotypes III IIIA strains estimated years respectively Hepatovirus A picornavirus enveloped contains positivesense singlestrand RNA packaged protein shell Only one serotype virus found multiple genotypes exist Codon use within genome biased unusually distinct host It also poor internal ribosome entry site In region codes HAV capsid highly conserved clusters rare codons restrict antigenic variability Vertebrates humans serve natural hosts Transmission routes fecaloral blood Following ingestion HAV enters bloodstream epithelium oropharynx intestine The blood carries virus target liver multiplies within hepatocytes Kupffer cells liver macrophages Viral replication cytoplasmic Entry host cell achieved attachment virus host receptors mediates endocytosis Replication follows positivestranded RNA virus replication model Translation takes place viral initiation The virus exits host cell lysis viroporins Virions secreted bile released stool HAV excreted large numbers days prior appearance symptoms antiHAV IgM antibodies blood The incubation period – days risk death infected less citation needed Within liver hepatocytes RNA genome released protein coat translated cells ribosomes Unlike picornaviruses virus requires intact eukaryotic initiation factor G eIFG initiation translation The requirement factor results inability shut host protein synthesis unlike picornaviruses The virus must inefficiently compete cellular translational machinery may explain poor growth cell culture Presumably reason virus strategically adopted naturally highly deoptimized codon usage respect cellular host Precisely strategy works quite clear yetcitation needed No apparent virusmediated cytotoxicity occurs presumably virus requirement intact eIFG liver pathology likely immunemediated The virus spreads fecal–oral route infections often occur conditions poor sanitation overcrowding Hepatitis A transmitted parenteral route rarely blood blood products Foodborne outbreaks common ingestion shellfish cultivated polluted water associated high risk infection About acute

actscitation needed In developing countries regions poor hygiene standards rates infection virus high illness usually contracted early childhood As incomes rise access clean water increases incidence HAV decreases In developed countries though infection contracted primarily susceptible young adults infected virus trips countries high incidence disease contact infectious persons Humans natural reservoir virus No known insect animal vectors transmit virus A chronic HAV state reported Although HAV excreted feces towards end incubation period specific diagnosis made detection HAVspecific IgM antibodies blood IgM antibody present blood following acute hepatitis A infection It detectable – weeks initial infection persists weeks The presence IgG antibodies blood means acute stage illness passed person immune infection IgG antibodies HAV also found blood following vaccination tests immunity virus based detection antibodies During acute stage infection liver enzyme alanine transferase ALT present blood levels much higher normal The enzyme comes liver cells damaged virus Hepatovirus A present blood viremia feces infected people weeks clinical illness develops Hepatitis A prevented vaccination good hygiene sanitation The two types vaccines contain either inactivated Hepatovirus A live attenuated virus Both provide active immunity future infection The vaccine protects HAV cases longer years In United States vaccine developed Maurice Hilleman team licensed vaccine first used children highrisk areas spread areas elevating levels infection The vaccine given injection An initial dose provides protection lasting one year starting – weeks vaccination second booster dose given six months later provides protection years The vaccine introduced initially recommended persons high risk Since Bahrain Israel embarked elimination programmes Australia China Belarus Italy Spain United States started similar programmes The incidence hepatitis A widespread vaccination practised decreased dramatically In China United States incidence hepatitis A decreased since In United States vaccination children recommended years age hepatitis A vaccination recommended younger months age It also recommended previously immunized exposed likely exposed due travel The CDC recommends vaccination infection men sex men No specific treatment hepatitis A known Recovery symptoms following infection may take several weeks months Therapy aimed maintaining comfort adequate nutritional balance including replacement fluids lost vomiting diarrhea In United States mortality rate hepatitis A estimated general population ranged – aged hospitalized icteric hepatitis The risk death acute liver failure following HAV infection increases age person underlying chronic liver diseasecitation needed Young children infected hepatitis A typically milder form disease usually lasting – weeks whereas adults tend experience much severe form disease Globally symptomatic HAV infections believed occur around million people year About million infections asymptomatic symptomatic occurred together Acute hepatitis A resulted deaths Developed countries low circulating levels hepatovirus A developing countries higher levels circulation Most adolescents adults developing countries already disease thus immune Adults midlevel countries may risk disease potential exposed Over cases hepatitis A reported CDC US number since dropped less cases reported per year The widespread hepatitis A outbreak United States occurred state Kentucky The outbreak believed started November By July states counties reported least one case hepatitis A total number suspected cases six deaths cases Louisville Kentucky By July outbreak reached cases deaths slowed new cases per month Another widespread outbreak United States US hepatitis outbreak affected least people killing four northeastern Ohio southwestern Pennsylvania late The outbreak blamed tainted green onions restaurant Monaca Pennsylvania In people Shanghai China infected HAV eating clams Anadara subcrenata contaminated river In June frozen berries sold US retailer Costco purchased around people subject recall least people infected HAV hospitalized In April frozen berries sold Costco subject recall least people Canada infected HAV three hospitalized In Australia February recall frozen berries issued least people contracted illness following consumption product In California particularly around San Diego Michigan Utah reported outbreaks hepatitis A led hospitalizations deaths
