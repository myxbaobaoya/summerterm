Human betaherpesvirus also called human cytomegalovirus HCMV species virus genus Cytomegalovirus turn member viral family known Herpesviridae herpesviruses It also commonly called CMV Within Herpesviridae HCMV belongs Betaherpesvirinae subfamily also includes cytomegaloviruses mammals CMV doublestranded DNA virus Although may found throughout body HCMV infections frequently associated salivary glands HCMV infection typically unnoticed healthy people lifethreatening immunocompromised HIVinfected persons organ transplant recipients newborn infants Congenital cytomegalovirus infection lead significant morbidity even death After infection HCMV remains latent within body throughout life reactivated time Eventually may cause mucoepidermoid carcinoma possibly malignancies prostate cancer breast cancer HCMV found geographic locations socioeconomic groups infects adults developed countries almost developing countries Of herpes viruses HCMV harbors genes dedicated altering evading innate adaptive host immunity represents lifelong burden antigenic T cell surveillance immune dysfunction Commonly indicated presence antibodies general population Seroprevalence agedependent individuals aged older infected CMV individuals aged older positive HCMV HCMV also virus frequently transmitted developing fetus HCMV infection widespread developing countries communities lower socioeconomic status represents significant viral cause birth defects industrialized countries Congenital HCMV leading infectious cause deafness learning disabilities intellectual disability children CMV also "seems large impact immune parameters later life may contribute increased morbidity eventual mortality" Human betaherpesvirus infection classic triad symptoms fever peaking late afternoon early evening pharyngitis usually exudative symmetrical adenopathycitation needed The mode HCMV transmission person person unknown presumed occur bodily fluids including saliva urine blood tears Cytomegalovirus commonly transmitted kissing sexual intercourse It also transferred infected mother unborn child Infection requires close intimate contact person secreting virus saliva urine bodily fluids CMV transmitted sexually via breast milk also occurs receiving transplanted organs blood transfusions Although HCMV highly contagious shown spread households among young children day care centers HCMV replicates within infected endothelial cells slow rate taking days cell culture Like herpesviruses HCMV expresses genes temporally controlled manner Immediate early genes – hours infection involved regulation transcription followed early genes – hours infection involved viral DNA replication transcriptional regulation Late genes expressed remainder infection viral egress typically code structural proteins While HCMV encodes functional DNA polymerase virus makes use host RNA polymerase transcription genes Synthesis viral doublestranded DNA genome occurs host cell nucleus within specialized viral replication compartments Nearly genes encoded HCMV strain AD deleted still result production infectious virus This suggests virus focuses avoiding host immune system timely entrance latencycitation needed CMV infections significant perinatal period people immunocompromised HCMV one vertically transmitted infections lead congenital abnormalities Others Toxoplasmosis Rubella Herpes simplex Congenital HCMV infection occurs mother suffers primary infection pregnancycitation needed Up every live births infected Five percent develop multiple handicaps

psychomotor retardationcitation needed However infants born preterm infected HCMV birth may experience cognitive motor impairments later life CMV infection reactivation people whose immune systems compromisedfor example people received transplants significantly burnedcauses illness increases risk death CMV reactivation commonly seen people severe colitis Specific disease entities recognized people People without CMV infection given organ transplants CMVinfected donors require prophylactic treatment valganciclovir ideally ganciclovir regular serological monitoring detect rising CMV titre treated early establishment potentially lifethreatening infection preventedcitation needed CMV infections still clinical significance adult immunocompetent populations The question whether latent CMV infection negative effects people otherwise healthy debated answer clear discussions focused whether latent CMV might increase risk cardiovascular diseases cancers Most healthy people infected HCMV birth symptoms Some develop syndrome similar infectious mononucleosis glandular fever prolonged fever mild hepatitis A sore throat common After infection virus remains latent lymphocytes body rest persons life Overt disease rarely occurs unless immunity suppressed either drugs infection old age Initial HCMV infection often asymptomatic followed prolonged inapparent infection virus resides mononuclear cells without causing detectable damage clinical illnesscitation needed Infectious CMV may shed bodily fluids infected person found urine saliva blood tears semen breast milk The shedding virus occur intermittently without detectable signs symptoms CMV infection demonstrated microscopically detection intranuclear inclusion bodies On HE staining inclusion bodies stain dark pink called "owls eye" inclusion bodies HCMV infection important certain highrisk groups Major areas risk infection include prenatal postnatal infants immunocompromised individuals organ transplant recipients persons leukemia infected human immunodeficiency virus HIV In HIV infected persons HCMV considered AIDSdefining infection indicating Tcell count dropped low levels Lytically replicating viruses disrupt cytoskeleton causing massive cell enlargement source virus name A study published links infection CMV high blood pressure mice suggests result CMV infection blood vessel endothelium humans major cause atherosclerosis Researchers also found cells infected CMV created renin protein known contribute high blood pressure Human CMV causes cellular senescence could contribute chronic inflammation inflammaging Human CMV also linked ageassociated T cell dysfunction contributing immunosenescence COVID symptom severity associated CMV although exact mechanism elucidated CMV encodes protein UL involved immune evasion NK cell responses It binds ligands ULBP ULBP MICB NK cell activating receptor NKGD prevents surface expression These ligands normally upregulated times cellular stress viral infection preventing upregulation CMV prevent host cell dying due NK cells A substantial portion immune system involved continuously controlling CMV drains resources immune system Death rates infectious disease accelerate age CMV infection correlates reduced effectiveness vaccination Persons highest levels CMV antibodies much higher risk death causes compared persons antibodies Most infections CMV go undiagnosed virus usually produces symptoms tends reactivate intermittently without symptoms Persons infected CMV develop antibodies virus persist body lifetime individual A number laboratory tests detect antibodies CMV developed determine infection occurred widely available commercial laboratories In addition virus cultured specimens obtained urine throat swabs bronchial lavages tissue samples detect active infection Both qualitative quantitative polymerase chain reaction PCR testing CMV available well allowing physicians monitor viral load people infected CMV The CMV
