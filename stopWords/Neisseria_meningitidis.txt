Neisseria meningitidis, often referred meningococcus, Gramnegative bacterium cause meningitis forms meningococcal disease meningococcemia, lifethreatening sepsis. The bacterium referred coccus round, specifically diplococcus tendency form pairs. About adults carriers bacteria nasopharynx. As exclusively human pathogen, main cause bacterial meningitis children young adults, causing developmental impairment death cases. It causes form bacterial meningitis known occur epidemically, mainly Africa Asia. It occurs worldwide epidemic endemic form. N. meningitidis spread saliva respiratory secretions coughing, sneezing, kissing, chewing toys sharing source fresh water. It also reported transmitted oral sex cause urethritis men. It infects host cells sticking long thin extensions called pili surfaceexposed proteins Opa Opc several virulence factors. Meningococcus cause meningitis forms meningococcal disease. It initially produces general symptoms like fatigue, fever, headache rapidly progress neck stiffness, coma death cases. Petechiae occur cases. Chance survival highly correlated blood cortisol levels, lower levels prior steroid administration corresponding increased patient mortality. Symptoms meningococcal meningitis easily confused caused bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae Streptococcus pneumoniae. Suspicion meningitis medical emergency immediate medical assessment recommended. Current guidance United Kingdom case meningococcal meningitis septicaemia infection blood suspected, intravenous antibiotics given ill person admitted hospital. This means laboratory tests may less likely confirm presence Neisseria meningitidis antibiotics dramatically lower number bacteria body. The UK guidance based idea reduced ability identify bacteria outweighed reduced chance death. Septicaemia caused Neisseria meningitidis received much less public attention meningococcal meningitis even though septicaemia linked infant deaths. Meningococcal septicaemia typically causes purpuric rash, lose color pressed glass slide "nonblanching" cause classical symptoms meningitis. This means condition may ignored aware significance rash. Septicaemia carries approximate mortality rate hours initial onset. Other severe complications include Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome, massive, usually bilateral, hemorrhage adrenal glands caused fulminant meningococcemia, adrenal insufficiency, disseminated intravascular coagulation. Not instances purpuralike rash due meningococcal septicaemia; possible causes, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ITP; platelet disorder Henoch–Schönlein purpura, also need prompt investigation. N. meningitidis Gramnegative diplococcus since outer inner membranes thin layer peptidoglycan between. It .–. micrometers size. It tests positive enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. N. meningitidis part normal nonpathogenic flora nasopharynx – adults. It colonizes infects humans, never isolated animals. This thought stem bacterium's inability get iron sources human transferrin lactoferrin. Diseasecausing strains classified according antigenic structure polysaccharide capsule. Serotype distribution varies markedly around world. Among identified capsular types N. meningitidis, six A, B, C, W, X, Y account disease cases worldwide. Type A prevalent Africa Asia, rarepractically absent North America. In United States, serogroup B predominant cause disease mortality, followed serogroup C. The multiple subtypes hindered development universal vaccine meningococcal disease. Lipooligosaccharide LOS component outer membrane N. meningitidis. This acts endotoxin responsible septic shock hemorrhage due destruction red blood cells. Other virulence factors include polysaccharide capsule prevents host phagocytosis aids evasion host immune response. Adhesion another key virulence strategy successfully invade host cell. There several known proteins involved adhesion invasion, mediate interactions specific host cell receptors. These include Type IV pilin adhesin mediates attachment bacterium epithelial cells nasopharynx, surfaceexposed Opa Opc proteins mediate interactions specific host cell receptors, NadA involved adhesion. Pathogenic meningococci invaded bloodstream must able survive new niche, facilitated acquisition utilisation iron FetA Hmbr, resisting intracellular oxidative killing producing catalase superoxide dismutase ability avoid complement mediated killing fHbp. Meningococci produce IgA protease, enzyme cleaves IgA class antibodies thus allows bacteria evade subclass humoral immune system. A hypervirulent strain discovered China. Its impact yet determined. Factor H binding protein fHbp exhibited N. meningitidis commensal species main inhibitor alternative complement pathway. fHbp protects meningococci complementmediated death human serum experiments, also shown protect meningococci antimicrobial peptides vitro. Factor H binding protein key pathogenesis N. meningitidis, is, therefore, important potential vaccine candidate. Porins also important factor complement inhibition pathogenic commensal species. Porins important nutrient acquisition. Porins also recognized TLR, bind complement factors Cb, Cb, factor H, Cbp complement factor bbinding protein. Cooperation pili CRmediated internalization another function porins. Ability translocate host cells modulate reactive oxygen species production apoptosis made possible porins, well. Strains species express different porins. At least complete genomes Neisseria meningitidis strains determined encode , , proteins. The genome strain MC serogroup B ,,base pairs. When sequenced , found contain open reading frames ORFs. Of these, biological function predicted .. There three major islands horizontal DNA transfer found. Two encode proteins involved pathogenicity. The third island codes hypothetical proteins. They also found genes undergo phase variation pathogen known. Phase variation mechanism helps pathogen evade immune system host. The genome size strain H . Mb, encodes , open reading frames ORFs, compared . Mb , ORFs MC. Both strains GC content .. A comparison MC showed four genes uniquely present H nine genes present MC. Of ORFs H, , show sequence identity. The complete genome sequence strain NMA serogroup A consists one circular chromosome size ,, bp, average GC content .. The chromosome predicted possess rRNA operons, insertion elements IS, tRNAs, , ORFs. There public database available N. meningitidis core genome multilocus sequence typing cMILST. Available at: https:pubmlst.orgbigsdb?dbpubmlstneisseriaseqdef Genetic transformation process recipient bacterial cell takes DNA neighboring cell integrates DNA recipient's genome recombination. In N. meningitidis, DNA transformation requires presence short DNA sequences – mers residing coding regions donor DNA. These sequences called DNA uptake sequences DUSs. Specific recognition sequences mediated type IV pilin. In N. meningitidis DUSs occur significantly higher density genes involved DNA repair recombination well restrictionmodification replication annotated gene groups. The overrepresentation DUS DNA repair recombination genes may reflect benefit maintaining integrity DNA repair recombination machinery preferentially taking genome maintenance genes, could replace damaged counterparts recipient cell. N. meningititis colonizes nasopharyngeal mucosa, rich macrophages. Upon activation, macrophages produce superoxide O− hydrogen peroxide HO. Thus N. meningitidis likely encounter oxidative stress life cycle. Consequently, important benefit genetic transformation N. meningitidis may maintenance recombination repair machinery cell removes oxidative DNA damages caused reactive oxygen. This consistent general idea transformation benefits bacterial pathogens facilitating repair DNA damages produced oxidative defenses host infection. Meningococci population extensively diverse genetically, due horizontal gene transfers nasophanrynx. Gene transfer occur within genomes Neisseria species, main mechanism acquiring new traits. This facilitated natural competence meningococci take foreign DNA. The commensal species Neisseria act reservoir genes acquired, example, capsule switching occur means hiding immune system. An invasive N. meningitidis strain serogroup C broke Nigeria strain new sequence type, ST determined multilocus sequence typing. It determined commensal strain N. meningitidis acquired kb prophage, meningococcal diseaseassociated island MDAΦ, previously associated hyperinvasiveness; full serogroup C capsule operon, thus becoming hypervirulent strain. This illustrates hypervirulent strains arise nonpathgenic strains due high propensity gene transfers DNA uptake N. meningitidis. A small amount cerebrospinal fluid CSF sent laboratory soon possible analysis. The diagnosis suspected, Gramnegative diplococci seen Gram stain centrifuged sample CSF; sometimes located inside white blood cells. The microscopic identification takes around – hours specimen arrival laboratory. The gold standard diagnosis microbiological isolation N. meningitidis growth sterile body fluid, could CSF blood. Diagnosis confirmed organism grown, often chocolate agar plate, also ThayerMartin agar. To differentiate bacterial growth species small amount bacterial colony tested oxidase, catalase clinically relevant Neisseria show positive reaction, carbohydrates maltose, sucrose, glucose, N. meningitidis ferment is, utilize glucose maltose. Finally, serology determines subgroup N. meningitidis, important epidemiological surveillance purposes; may often done specialized laboratories. The tests take minimum – hours turnaround time growing organism, week serotyping. Growth often fail, either antibiotics given preemptively, specimens inappropriately transported, organism extremely susceptible antibiotics fastidious temperature, CO growth medium requirements. Polymerase chain reaction PCR tests available, mostly industrialized countries, increasingly used; PCR rapidly identify organism, works even antibiotics given. All recent contacts infected patient days onset receive medication prevent contracting infection. This especially includes young children child caregivers nurseryschool contacts, well anyone direct exposure patient kissing, sharing utensils, medical interventions mouthtomouth resuscitation. Anyone frequently ate, slept stayed patient's home days onset symptom, sat beside patient airplane flight classroom hours longer, also receive chemoprophylaxis. The agent choice usually oral rifampicin days. Receiving dose Meningococcal vaccine traveling country "meningitis belt" booster meningitis vaccine, normally five years apart could prevent someone getting infection pathogen. A number vaccines available U.S. prevent meningococcal disease. Some vaccines cover serogroup B, others cover A, C, W, Y. The Centers Disease Control Prevention CDC recommends teenagers receive MenACWY vaccine booster, optional MenB. MenACWY MenB also recommended people ages various medical conditions social risk factors. A meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine MPSV available since meningococcal vaccine licensed people older . MPSV may used people – years old MCV vaccines available contraindicated. Two meningococcal conjugate vaccines MCV licensed use U.S. The first conjugate vaccine licensed , second . Conjugate vaccines preferred vaccine people years age. It indicated impaired immunity, nephrotic syndrome splenectomy. In June , U.S. Food Drug Administration FDA approved combination vaccine two types meningococcal diseases Hib disease infants children weeks months old. The vaccine, Menhibrix, designed prevent disease caused Neisseria meningitidis serogroups C Y, Haemophilus influenzae type b Hib. It first meningococcal vaccine could given infants young six weeks old. In October FDA approved first vaccine effective serogroup B, named Trumenba, use yearold individuals. In , Meningitis Vaccine Project introduced vaccine called MenAfriVac African meningitis belt. It made generic drug maker Serum Institute India cost U.S. cents per injection. Beginning Burkina Faso , given million people across Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, Togo Gambia. The vaccination campaign resulted nearelimination serogroup A meningitis participating countries. Persons confirmed N. meningitidis infection hospitalized immediately treatment antibiotics. Because meningococcal disease disseminate rapidly, single dose intramuscular antibiotic often given earliest possible opportunity, even hospitalization, disease symptoms look suspicious enough. Thirdgeneration cephalosporin antibiotics i.e. cefotaxime, ceftriaxone used treat suspected cultureproven meningococcal infection antibiotic susceptibility results available. Clinical practice guidelines endorse empirical treatment event lumbar puncture collect cerebrospinal fluid CSF laboratory testing cannot first performed. Antibiotic treatment may affect results microbiology tests, diagnosis may made basis bloodcultures clinical examination. N. meningitidis major cause illness, developmental impairment death childhood industrialized countries responsible epidemics Africa Asia. Every year, , , people become infected N. meningitidis US, frequency ,. Children younger years greatest risk, followed teenagers high school age. Rates African meningitis belt high , introduction vaccine . The incidence meningococcal disease highest among infants children younger yearold whose immune system relatively immature. In industrialized countries second peak incidence young adults, congregating closely, living dormitories smoking. Vaccine development ongoing. It spread saliva respiratory secretions coughing, sneezing, kissing, chewing toys. Inhalation respiratory droplets carrier may someone early stages disease transmit bacteria. Close contact carrier predominant risk factor. Other risk factors include weakened general local immune response, recent upper respiratory infection, smoking, complement deficiency. The incubation period short, days. In susceptible individuals, N. meningitidis may invade bloodstream cause systemic infection, sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, breakdown circulation, septic shock. In Ettore Marchiafava Angelo Celli first observed bacterium inside cells cerebral spinal fluid CSF. In Anton Weichselbaum isolated bacterium CSF patients bacterial meningitis. He named bacterium Diplococcus intracellularis meningitidis. Components Neisseria meningitidis harnessed biotechnology. Its Cas enzyme useful tool CRISPR gene editing enzyme small distinct targeting features commonly used enzyme Streptococcus pyogenes. The cellsurface protein FrpC Neisseria meningitidis engineered allow covalent coupling proteins, generates reactive anhydride exposed calcium. The bacterium also expresses unique enzymes able cleave IgA antibodies.
