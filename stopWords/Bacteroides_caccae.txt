Bacteroides caccae saccharolytic gramnegative bacterium genus Bacteroides. They obligate anaerobes first isolated human feces s. Prior discovery, known A DNA homology group. The type strain identified ATCC . Bacteroides caccae saccharolytic anaerobic, nonmotile Gramnegative bacteria. They DNA GC content mol . Growth occurs human temperature °C anaerobic conditions. There growth °C °C. Its cell shapes rods .. . µm size. The rods found single cells pairs. In broth culture mixed fermentable carbohydrate, cells appear vacuolated beaded. The surface colonies cells grown BHI blood agar plates following hours incubation show circular cell .– mm diameter. In addition, colonies convex, gray, translucent, shiny, smooth. Growth rabbit blood shows slight hemolysis. In glucose broth, cultures appear turbid smooth sediment final pH range – .. The type strain reduces neutral red produce hydrogen sulfide. Growth peptoneyeast extractglucose broth cultures bile yields vast amounts acetate succinate minor amounts propionate isovalerate. Lactate threonine used type strain. B. caccae produces trace amount . hydrogen. They hydrolyze esculin, weakly digest gelatin, susceptible chloramphenicol clindamycin, susceptible penicillin G tetracycline. For onset intestinal bowel diseases IBD Crohn's disease CD Ulcerative colitis UC, commensal enteric bacteria generally required pathogenic factor. B. caccae contains TonBlinked outer membrane protein called OmpW characterized particular strain. The OmpW protein contains features similar bacterial TonBlinked outer membrane protein allows bacteria increase ability iron vitamin uptake environment lacks variables. The TonBlinked outer membrane protein contains TonB box highly conserved also present OmpW. OmpW may play role facilitating organism's ability uptake substrates important commensal bacterial survival intestine. The immunological finding OmpW elevation antiOmpW IgA levels patients Crohn's disease comparison IgA levels patients ulcerative colitis healthy subjects. More remains elucidated potential pathogenicity regards OmpW. In addition, B. caccae also found cultures infections appendix abdomen peritoneal Bacteroides caccae specified fiberdegrading microbial specialist microbiomes Western individuals. In study geared determining fermentation pectin B. caccae rabbit cecum, determined cultures grown pectin produced acetate formate, lactate, fumarate, succinate opposed cultures grown glucose yielded vast amounts lactate. This elucidates metabolism plant fiber human commensal. In addition, B. caccae showed growth arabinan pectin, arabinoxylan wheat, xylan, xyloglucan, glucomannan, galactomannan, Bglucan, lichenin, laminarin. They grow hostderived glycans like neutral mucin Oglycans, chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid. The monosaccharides induce growth arabinose, fructose, fucose, galactose, galacturonic acid, glucose, glucuronic acid, glucosamine, mannose, Nacetylgalactosamine, Nacetylglucosamine, Nacetylneuraminic acid, rhamnose, ribose, xylose
