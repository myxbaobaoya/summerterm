Haemophilus parainfluenzae species Haemophilus. It one HACEK organisms. H. parainfluenzae opportunistic pathogen associated endocarditis, bronchitis, otitis, conjunctivitis, pneumonia, abscesses genital tract infections. H. parainfluenzae biotypes I II capable natural genetic transformation. Natural genetic transformation bacterial adaptation DNA transfer. In order bacterium bind, take recombine exogenous DNA genome must enter special physiological state termed natural competence. In H. parainfluenzae, competence induced late stationary phase growth. Natural DNA transformation may play major role exchange genetic information among H. parainfluenzae isolates. This Gammaproteobacteriarelated article stub. You help Wikipedia expanding it.
