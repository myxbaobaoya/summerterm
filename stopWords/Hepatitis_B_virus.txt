Hepatitis B virus HBV partially doublestranded DNA virus species genus Orthohepadnavirus member Hepadnaviridae family viruses This virus causes disease hepatitis B Despite vaccine prevent Hepatitis B HBV remains global health problem Hepatitis B acute later become chronic leading diseases health conditions In addition causing hepatitis infection HBV lead cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma It also suggested may increase risk pancreatic cancer Viral infection Hepatitis B virus HBV causes many hepatocyte changes due direct action protein encoded virus HBx indirect changes due large increase intracellular reactive oxygen species ROS infection HBx appears dysregulate number cellular pathways HBx causes dysregulation part binding genomic DNA changing expression patterns miRNAs affecting histone methyltransferases binding SIRT protein activate transcription cooperating histone methylases demethylases change cell expression patterns HBx partly responsible approximate fold increase intracellular reactive oxygen species ROS upon chronic HBV infection Increased ROS caused part localization HBx mitochondria HBx decreases mitochondrial membrane potential In addition another HBV protein HBsAg also increases ROS interactions endoplasmic reticulum The increase ROS HBV infection causes inflammation leads increase ROS ROS cause types DNA damage Oxidative DNA damage mutagenic In addition repair DNA damage cause epigenetic alterations site damage repair DNA Epigenetic alterations mutations may cause defects cellular machinery contribute liver disease By time accumulating epigenetic mutational changes eventually cause progression cancer epigenetic alterations appear larger role carcinogenesis mutations Only one two genes TP perhaps ARIDA mutated liver cancers genes hypermethylated promoters repressing gene expression liver cancers seven genes hypermethylated liver cancers In addition alterations sites DNA repair epigenetic alterations also caused HBx recruiting DNA methyltransferase enzymes DNMT andor DNMTA specific gene loci alter methylation levels gene expression HBx also alters histone acetylation affect gene expression Several thousand proteincoding genes appear HBxbinding sites In addition protein coding genes microRNAs Long noncoding RNAs also affected binding HBx promoters Each altered microRNA affect expression several hundred messenger RNAs see microRNA Hepatitis B virus classified genus Orthohepadnavirus contains species The genus classified part Hepadnaviridae family contains four genera Avihepadnavirus Herpetohepadnavirus Metahepadnavirus Parahepadnavirus This family viruses member viral order Blubervirales Viruses similar hepatitis B found apes orangutans gibbons gorillas chimpanzees Old World monkeys New World woolly monkeys woolly monkey hepatitis B virus suggesting ancient origin virus primates The virus divided four major serotypes adr adw ayr ayw based antigenic epitopes present envelope proteins These serotypes based common determinant two mutually exclusive determinant pairs dy wr The viral strains also divided ten genotypes A–J forty subgenotypes according overall nucleotide sequence variation genome The genotypes distinct geographical distribution used tracing evolution transmission virus Differences genotypes affect disease severity course likelihood complications response treatment Available Hootone Remedies The serotypes genotypes necessarily correspond Genotype D subgenotypes A number yet unclassified Hepatitis Blike species isolated bats Hepatitis B virus member Hepadnavirus family The virus particle called Dane particle virion consists outer lipid envelope icosahedral nucleocapsid core composed protein The nucleocapsid encloses viral DNA DNA polymerase reverse transcriptase activity similar retroviruses The outer envelope contains embedded proteins involved viral binding entry susceptible cells The virus one smallest enveloped animal viruses virion diameter nm pleomorphic forms exist including filamentous spherical bodies lacking core These particles infectious composed lipid protein forms part surface virion called surface antigen HBsAg produced excess life cycle virus It consists Hepatitis D virus requires HBV envelope particles become virulent The early evolution HBV like viruses difficult establish The identification hepadnaviruses wide range vertebrates suggests long coevolution The identification endogenous hepadnaviridae elements shared various bird species shows presence virus birds least M years Although similar evidence missing mammals phylogenetic position orthohepadnaviruses sister clade avihepadnaviruses suggests presence virus amniote ancestor subsequent coevolution birds mammals divergence M years ago It also proposed New World bat hepadnavirus may origin primate hepadnaviruses Avihepadnaviruses lack X protein vestigial X reading frame present genome duck hepadnavirus The X protein may evolved DNA glycosylase Recently reconstruction HBV genomes ancient human remains allowed investigating evolution virus humans details In study reconstructed ancient HBV genomes proved presence virus humans since least years The recent common ancestor known human HBV lineages dated years ago However cannot said whether virus present humans long acquired shortly another animal species The evolution HBV humans shown reflect known events human history first peopling Americas late Pleistocene Neolithic transition Europe These studies also showed ancient HBV strains still infect humans became extinct HBV strains found African SouthEast Asian apes chimpanzees gorillas orangutans gibbons appear related human HBV strains could reflect past crossspecies transmission events A study isolates circumpolar Arctic human population proposed ancestor subgenotype B endemic type found population ancestral virus originated Asia years ago HPD BC – AD Coalescence occurred AD This subgenotype spread Asia initially Greenland
