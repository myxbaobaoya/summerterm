Cardiobacterium hominis Gramnegative bacillus rodshaped bacterium commonly grouped bacteria HACEK group. It one several bacteria normally present mouth upper part respiratory tract nose throat. However, may also rarely cause endocarditis, infection heart valves. C. hominis catalasenegative, oxidasepositive, indoleproducing, Gramnegative rod. Its morphology classically described highly pleomorphic irregularly staining, although homogeneous bacilli uniform shapes may seen addition yeast extract. Historically, C. hominis sensitive penicillin penicillin derivatives ampicillin. However, penicillinresistant strains, including produce betalactamases, described increasing frequency. Clinical guidelines thus recommend C. hominis HACEK organisms presumed harbor ampicillin resistance therefore treated thirdgeneration cephalosporin. C. hominis HACEK organisms also exhibit vitro susceptibility trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, aztreonam. C. hominis often resistant erythromycin. Since cefotaxime use may appropriate C. hominis endocarditis, alternative regimen might include association coamoxiclav gentamicin.
