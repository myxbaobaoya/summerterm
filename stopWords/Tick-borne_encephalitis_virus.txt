Tickborne encephalitis virus TBEV positivestrand RNA virus associated tickborne encephalitis genus Flavivirus TBEV member genus Flavivirus Other close relatives members TBEV serocomplex include Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus Kyasanur Forest disease virus Alkhurma virus Louping ill virus Langat virus TBEV three subtypes The reference strain Sofjin strain TBEV positivesense singlestranded RNA virus contained nm spherical enveloped capsid The TBEV genome approximately kb size contains cap single open reading frame UTRs without polyadenylation Like flaviviruses TBEV genome codes ten viral proteins three structural seven nonstructural NS The structural proteins C capsid PrM premembrane cleaved produce final membrane protein M E envelope The seven nonstructural proteins NS NSA NSB NS NSA NSB NS The role nonstructural proteins known NS serves RNAdependent RNA polymerase NS protease complex NSB helicase activity Structural nonstructural proteins required genome infectious All viral proteins expressed single large polyprotein order C PrM E NS NSA NSB NS NSA NSB NS Infection vector begins tick takes blood meal infected host This occur part ticks life cycle horizontal transmission infected nymphs uninfected larvae cofeeding host thought key maintaining circulation TBEV TBEV blood host infects tick midgut pass salivary glands passed next host In nonadult ticks TBEV transmitted transtadially infecting cells destroyed molting thus tick remains infectious throughout life Infected adult ticks may able lay eggs infected transmitting virus transorvarially In humans infection begins skin exception foodborne cases infections site bite infected tick Langerhans cells macrophages skin preferentially targeted TBEV envelope E proteins recognize heparan sulfate likely receptors

Pr segments dissociate resulting fully mature infectious virus However partially mature immature viruses sometimes released well immature viruses noninfectious E proteins fusion competent partially mature viruses still capable infection With exception foodborne cases infection begins skin site tick bite Skin dendritic Langerhans cells DCs preferentially targeted Initially virus replicates locally immune response triggered viral components recognized cytosolic pattern recognition receptors PRRs Tolllike receptors TLRs Recognition causes release cytokines including interferons IFN α β γ chemokines attracting migratory immune cells site bite The infection may halted stage cleared onset noticeable symptoms Notably tick saliva enhances infection modulating host immune response dampening apoptotic signals If infection continues migratory DCs macrophages become infected travel local draining lymph node activation polymorphonuclear leukocytes monocytes complement system activated The draining lymph node also serve viral amplification site TBEV gains systemic access This viremic stage corresponds first symptomatic phase prototypical biphasic pattern tickborne encephalitis TBEV strong preference neuronal tissue neuroinvasive The initial viremic stage allows access number preferential tissues However exact mechanism TBEV crosses central nervous system CNS unclear There several proposed mechanism TBEV breaching bloodbrain barrier BBB The "Trojan Horse" mechanism whereby TBEV gains access CNS infecting immune cell passes BBB Disruption increased permeability BBB immune immune cytokines Via infection olfactory neurons Via retrograde transport along peripheral nerves CNS Infection cells make part BBB CNS infection brings second phase classic biphasic infection pattern associated European subtype CNS disease immunopathological release inflammatory cytokines coupled action cytotoxic CD T cells possibly NK cells results inflammation apoptosis infected cells responsible many CNS symptoms TBEV specific IgM IgG antibodies produced response infection IgM antibodies appear peak first well reaching higher levels typically dissipate months post infection though exists considerable variation patient patient IgG levels peak weeks appearance CNS symptoms decline slightly dissipate likely conferring life long immunity patient The ancestor extant strains appears separated several clades approximately years ago The Siberian Far Eastern subtypes diverged years ago A second analysis suggests earlier date evolution years ago rapid increase number strains starting around years ago Different strains virus transmitted least three times Japan – years ago The strains circulating Latvia appear originated Russia Western Europe Estonia appear originated Russia The Lithuanian strains appear related Western Europe Phylogenetic analysis indicates European Siberian TBEV subtypes closely related Fareastern subtype closer Louping Ill Virus However antigenic relatedness based E NS NS proteins three subtypes highly similar Louping Ill virus closest relative outside collective TBEV group Though first description may TBE appears records Scandinavia identification TBEV virus occurred Soviet Union The investigation began due outbreak believed Japanese Encephalitis "Summer encephalitis" among Soviet troops stationed along border Japanese empire present day Peoples Republic China near Far Eastern city Khabarovsk The expedition led virologist Lev A Zilber assembled team twenty young scientists number related fields acarology microbiology neurology epidemiology The expedition arrived Khabarovsk May divided squads Northernled Elizabeth N Levkovich working Khabarovski Krai Southernled Alexandra D Sheboldaeva working Primorski Krai Inside month May expedition identified ticks likely vector collected I persucatus ticks exposure bare skin entomologist Alexander V Gutsevich virologist Mikhail P Chumakov isolated virus ticks feeding intentionally infected mice During summer five expeditions members became infected TBEV fatalities three five suffered damaging sequelae The expedition returned midAugust October Zilber Sheboldova arrested falsely accused spreading Japanese encephalitis Expedition epidemiologist Tamara M Safonov arrested following January protesting charges Zilber Sheboldova As consequence arrests one important initial works published authorship expedition acarologist Vasily S Mironov Zilber released managed restore along Sheboldova coauthorship initial work however Safanov Sheboldova released spent years
