Cutibacterium acnes formerly Propionibacterium acnes relatively slowgrowing typically aerotolerant anaerobic grampositive bacterium rod linked skin condition acne also cause chronic blepharitis endophthalmitis latter particularly following intraocular surgery Its genome sequenced study shown several genes generate enzymes degrading skin proteins may immunogenic activating immune system The species largely commensal part skin flora present healthy adult humans skin It usually barely detectable skin healthy preadolescents It lives among things primarily fatty acids sebum secreted sebaceous glands follicles It may also found throughout gastrointestinal tract Originally identified Bacillus acnes later named Propionibacterium acnes ability generate propionic acid In P acnes taxonomically reclassified result biochemical genomic studies In terms phylogenetic tree structure DNA G C content cutaneous species distinguishable species previously categorized P acnes As part restructuring novel genus Cutibacterium created cutaneous species including formerly identified Propionibacterium acnes Propionibacterium avidum Propionibacterium granulosum Characterization phylotypes C acnes active field research C acnes bacteria predominantly live deep within follicles pores although also found surface healthy skin In follicles C acnes bacteria use sebum cellular debris metabolic byproducts surrounding skin tissue primary sources energy nutrients Elevated production sebum hyperactive sebaceous glands sebaceous hyperplasia blockage follicle cause C acnes bacteria grow multiply C acnes bacteria secrete many proteins including several digestive enzymes These enzymes involved digestion sebum acquisition nutrients They also destabilize layers cells form walls follicle The cellular damage metabolic byproducts bacterial debris produced rapid growth C acnes follicles trigger inflammation This inflammation lead symptoms associated common skin disorders folliculitis acne vulgaris Acne vulgaris disease commonly associated C acnes infection Acne vulgaris chronic inflammatory disease pilosebaceous unit includes hair follicle hair shaft sebaceous gland million people affected globally disease C acnes starts colonize skin around years prior puberty grows exponentially time This many teens young adults struggle acne Prescriptions treat acne often antibiotics However rise antibiotic resistance medications like isotretinoin commonly known Accutane used patients severe resistant acnecitation needed The damage caused C acnes associated inflammation make affected tissue susceptible colonization opportunistic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Preliminary research shows healthy pores colonized C acnes unhealthy ones universally include nonporeresident Staphylococcus epidermidis amongst bacterial contaminants Whether root causality opportunistic side effect complex pathological duality C acnes particular Staphylococcus species known Current research pointed idea C acnes S epidermidis symbiotic relationship Both bacteria exist normal flora skin disrupt balance bacteria skin result acne bacterial infection C acnes common cause chronic endophthalmitis following cataract surgery The pathogen may also cause corneal ulcers C acnes found herniated discs The propionic acid secretes creates microfractures surrounding bone These microfractures sensitive found antibiotics helpful resolving type low back pain C acnes found bronchoalveolar lavage approximately patients sarcoidosis associated disease activity also found controls The subspecies C acnes cause infections otherwise sterile tissues prior medical procedures however subspecies found skin individuals acneprone skin likely local contaminants Moderate severe acne vulgaris appears often associated virulent strains C acnes often considered opportunistic pathogen causing range postoperative devicerelated infections eg surgical infections postneurosurgical infections infected joint prostheses especially shoulder neurosurgical shunt infections endocarditis patients prosthetic heart valves predominantly men C acnes may play role conditions including SAPHO synovitis acne pustulosis hyperostosis osteitis syndrome sarcoidosis sciatica It also suspected main bacterial source neuroinflammation Alzheimers disease brains It common contaminant blood cerebrospinal fluid cultures C acnes bacteria susceptible wide range antimicrobial molecules pharmaceutical natural sources The antibiotics frequently used treat acne vulgaris erythromycin clindamycin doxycycline minocycline Several families antibiotics also active C acnes bacteria including quinolones cephalosporins pleuromutilins penicillins sulfonamides The emergence antibioticresistant C acnes bacteria represents growing problem worldwide The problem especially pronounced North America Europe The antibiotic families C acnes likely acquire resistance macrolides eg erythromycin azithromycin lincosamides eg clindamycin tetracyclines eg doxycycline minocycline However C acnes bacteria susceptible many types antimicrobial chemicals found overthecounter antibacterial products including benzoyl peroxide triclosan chloroxylenol chlorhexidine gluconate Several naturally occurring molecules compounds toxic C acnes bacteria Some essential oils rosemary tea tree oil clove oil citrus oils contain antibacterial chemicals Natural honey also shown antibacterial properties may active C acnes The elements silver sulfur copper also demonstrated toxic towards many bacteria including C acnes C acnes glows orange exposed blacklight possibly due presence endogenous porphyrins It also killed ultraviolet light C acnes especially sensitive light – nanometer near ultraviolet range due endogenic porphyrin–coporphyrin III A total irradiance Joulescm inactivates species vitro Its photosensitivity enhanced pretreatment aminolevulinic acid boosts production chemical although causes significant side effects humans practice significantly better light treatment alone C acnes found endophyte plants Notably grapevine appears host endophytic population C acnes closely related humanassociated
