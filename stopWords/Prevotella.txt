See text. Prevotella genus Gramnegative bacteria. Prevotella spp. members oral, vaginal, gut microbiota often recovered anaerobic infections respiratory tract. These infections include aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, pulmonary empyema, chronic otitis media sinusitis. They isolated abscesses burns vicinity mouth, bites, paronychia, urinary tract infection, brain abscesses, osteomyelitis, bacteremia associated upper respiratory tract infections. Prevotella spp. predominate periodontal disease periodontal abscesses. Research human microbiota show human gut mainly inhabited two phyla bacteriaBacillota Bacteroidota, latter mostly dominated Bacteroides Prevotella genera. Prevotella Bacteroides thought common ancestor. Formally, two genera differentiated . However classification still undergoing, example Bacteroides melaninogenicus reclassified split Prevotella melaninogenica Prevotella intermedia. Either Prevotella Bacteroides dominate gut theorized antagonistic. Prevotella common nonWesternised populations consuming plantrich diet. In Western populations also associated vegetarian Mediterranean diets rich fruits vegetables. In accordance, genome analysis Prevotella copri showed deficient ability degrade host glycans genetically equipped plant glycan degradation. In study gut bacteria children Burkina Faso Africa, Prevotella made gut bacteria absent agematched European children. Studies suggest longterm diet strongly associated gut microbiome compositionthose eat protein animal fats typical Western diet predominantly Bacteroides bacteria, consume carbohydrates, especially fibre, Prevotella species dominate. Prevotella associated gut inflammation. It demonstrated increased levels P. copri might contribute chronic inflammation HIV patients. One single species isolate P. copri CB used different studies showed beneficial detrimental, depending context. Prevotella large genus high species diversity high genetic diversity strains. A recent study Prevotella derived humans compared gene repertoires species derived different body sites human. It also reported open pan genome showing vast diversity gene pool. In addition genetic overall microbiota differences host high genetic variety Prevotella makes difficult predict function different different individuals. Prevotella species may commensal vaginal, though increased abundance Prevotella vaginal mucosa associated bacterial vaginosis. Prevotella shown heritable bacterial group vaginal microbiome abundance linked body mass index hormonal milieu.citation needed Prevotella bivia produces lipopolysaccharides ammonia part vaginal mucus. It also associated epithelial cytokine production enhances growth bacterial vaginosisassociated organisms, Gardnerella vaginalis. The latter turn found stimulate growth P. bivia. Prevotella intermedia Prevotella nigrescens associated inflammatory periodontal diseases, pregnancy gingivitis, acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis adult periodontitis. Together Porphyromonas gingivalis known blackpigmenting anaerobes. All three require haemin source iron growth. These species shown bind lactoferrin released together contents neutrophils inflammation bleeding periodontitis patients. Lactoferrin inhibits growth P. gingivalis Prevotella species. Inorganic iron ironbinding proteins transferrin lactoferrin support growth P. intermedia, however heminâ€“ironcontaining compounds include hemin, human hemoglobin, bovine hemoglobin, bovine catalase stimulate growth Prevotella intermedia. Hemoglobinbinding protein cell surface P.intermedia described. P. copri correlated onset rheumatoid arthritis. An overgrowth Prevotella reduction Lactobacillus correlated onset osteomyelitis mice. The reduction Prevotella model mice led increase Lactobacillus showing protection effect osteomyelitis. Thus, changes microbiota Prevotella may related development osteomyelitis.
