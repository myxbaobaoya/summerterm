Granulicatella adiacens fastidious Grampositive cocci pairs, chains part nutritionally variant streptococci NVS. Like constituents NVS, cause bacteremia infective endocarditis IE, significant morbidity mortality. NVS less often implicated variety infections, including orbit, nasolacrimal duct breast implants. It commensal human mouth, genital, intestinal tracts, although rarely implicated infections, part due fastidious organism rarely identified laboratory environment. However, identification become frequent use commercial mediums automated identification systems. Because difficult identify, considered one causes culture negative IE. Identifying G. adiacens allow appropriate selection antibiotics, especially susceptibility testing available. Of human diseases caused G. adiacens, infective endocarditis IE common. Among members genus Granulicatella, G. adiacens seems capable causing IE, possibly due capacity bind cardiac valvular tissue. IE NVS species described indolentonset, often setting preexisting heart valve damage. The aortic mitral valves commonly affected. More often not, IE due NVS produces detectable vegetations, although classic IE signs e.g., Osler nodes usually present. Treatment failure frequently observed, approximately cases require prosthetic valve replacement. The Granulicatella genus resistant antibiotics viridans streptococci another common cause IE, although still often susceptible clindamycin, erythromycin, rifampicin vancomycin. Granulicatella spp. associated malodorous breath halitosis Japan. It grows best media supplemented thiol pyridoxal. Phenotypic identification genus difficult, feasible automated identification systems. S rRNA gene sequencing confirmatory. In , new type viridans streptococci classified "nutritionally variant streptococci" NVS. In , NVS subdivided Streptococcus defectiva Streptococcus adiacens, relocated create new genus Abiotrophia. In , three members Abiotrophia genus reclassified genus Granulicatella Granulicatella adiacens, balaenopterae elegans.
