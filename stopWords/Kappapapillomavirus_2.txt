The Shope papilloma virus SPV also known cottontail rabbit papilloma virus CRPV Kappapapillomavirus papillomavirus infects certain leporids causing keratinous carcinomas resembling horns typically near animals head The carcinomas metastasize become large enough interfere hosts ability eat causing starvation Richard E Shope investigated horns discovered virus important breakthrough study oncoviruses The virus originally discovered cottontail rabbits Midwestern US also infect brush rabbits blacktailed jackrabbits snowshoe hares European rabbits In hunters northwestern Iowa reported rabbits shot several "horn" protrusions many parts bodies including faces necks The virus also possible source myths jackalope rabbit horns antelope related cryptids wolpertinger Stories illustrations horned rabbits appear scientific treatises dating back many years Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique The Iowa reports led cancer researcher Richard E Shope investigate discovered virus He separated virus horny warts cottontail rabbits made one first mammalian tumor virus discoveries Shope determined protrusions keratinous carcinomas due infection CRPV Shopes research led development first mammalian model cancer caused virus He able isolate virus particles tumors captured animals use inoculate domestic rabbits developed similar tumors This contributed understanding fundamental mechanisms neoplasia formation new abnormal growth tissue The virus sequenced showing substantial sequence similarities HPVa It used model human papillomaviruses discovery The visible example role HPV vaccine developed based incorporating research done using virus model Similarly used investigate antiviral therapies There lack specific data reproductive cycle papillomaviruses Research conclusive coding regions expressed replication viral DNA The E region carried DNA required cis andor trans E largest Open reading frame set codons genome code proteins encoding base protein E similar COOHterminal domain Simian virus plays role viral DNA replication maintaining plasmids within cell Results found CRPV BPV found location genome indicates papillomaviruses likely similar methods replicating genomes outside chromosome A notable difference genomes four strains E protein almost twice long CRPV strains papillomaviruses The E protein somewhat homologous family ATP syntheses found mitochondria cattle The homology significant enough imply evolutionary relationship E beta chain ATP synthase family however function enzyme activity The E protein overlaps E open reading frames papillomaviruses These differences E proteins likely determine oncogenic virus The noncoding region homologies BPV Other homologies exist fact papillomaviruses repeated sequences noncoding parts genomes CRPV notable repeats long base pairs Many pairs stream transcription locations homologous promoter sequences SV The papillomavirus life cycle begins cells actively multiplying epithelial cells basal parabasal layers The differentiation cells necessary virus complete life cycle Transforming proteins E E induce Sphase lower epithelial layers Viral replication proteins E E also required form papilloma keep episomal viral genome replication low Genome amplification restrained viral replication proteins increase several viral proteins coexpressed The infected differentiating cells travel towards epithelial surface viral cycles late stage In upper epithelial layers promoter activity altered virus production E proteins expressed viral DNA amplification starts differentiated cells Following L L viral capsid proteins expressed infectious virions begin assemble Expression papillomavirus E protein correlates onset viral DNA amplification Using mutant cottontail rabbit papillomavirus SPV genome incapable expressing viral E protein shown E required productive stage SPV life cycle New Zealand White cottontail rabbits The virus particles assembled upper epithelium The virus capsomere icosahedral shell packaged base pair genome L protein copies copies L proteins inside L proteins gather PML body nuclear structures recruit L proteins virus assemblage L proteins necessary assemblage possible augment packaging infectivity Capsid proteins thought also gather PML bodies packaging Transmittance Papillomavirus requires release infected skin cell epithelial surface nonlytic They resistant desiccation enhancing survivability extracellular transfer hosts Cornified squame release surface epithelial cells may also contribute survival Immune detection virus host may also hindered antigen retention virus reaches upper epithelial cells When Richard E Shope began research SPV little known natural transmission virus vectors interactions virus hosts In lab setting Shope worked virus natural host cottontail rabbit Particularly worked cottontails Iowa western states United States He worked species discovered SPV restricted geographic range confined high plains western United States Therefore major host species SPV cottontail rabbit western United States Cottontail rabbits Shopes lab usually infected virus parasites rabbit ticks When infected SPV hosts develop papillomas hairbearing skin usually around face neck Shope found research rabbit epidermal cell transformation SPV requires interaction mesenchymal cells It found mesenchymal types support papillomatous transformation Shopes research also investigated vitamin A deficiencies excess might affect host susceptibility SPV Shope found deficiencies vitamin A affect relative growth papillomas cases excesses vitamin A Shope papillomas inhibited Therefore SPV infects host vitamin A plays important role hostvirus interactions Fluorescent antibody study identified locations viral antigens wild rabbit papillomas They present nucleus keratohyaline keratinized layer cells deeper proliferating epithelial cells In domesticated rabbits viral antigens present much smaller quantity superficial keratinized layers The investigation proposed virus present proliferating cell nuclei early development containing deficient amount proteins mostly nucleic acid The proteins may immunologically specific order keep transmissibility making masked virus Most homologous papillomaviruses actually CRPV HPVa This possibly viruses target skin From evolutionary perspective CRPV HPVa could diverged recently could converged due similar target CRPV member papillomaviruses related viruses family Infection rabbits follicular cell often occurs locations including ears nose eyelids anus The infection first appears red swollen area skin followed development circular papilloma warts keratinized horny warts Although transmission rabbits high tumors contain infectious virus Papilloma infections become malignant form squamous cell carcinoma Metastases form lungs lymph nodes advances develop kidneys liver Rabbit Papilloma displays tropism cutaneous epithelium Warts made nearly homogenous vertical tissue strands Their outer coloration typically black greyish cut sections usually white pinkish white fleshlike center Dark coloration due abundant melanin pigment The warts made several tight branching threadlike epidermis processes connected narrow tissue cores These growth structures indicate growth occurs simultaneously several different centers causing surrounding tissue bulge growths lateral pressure The normal epithelium abruptly transitions narrow zone rapidly thickening epithelial layers made rapidly multiplying cells Rabbits reinfected virus exhibit complete immunity transmit virus wild rabbits wild domestic rabbits A domestic strain cannot transmit another domestic rabbit however Immunologically papillomatosis virus related fibroma myxoma rabbits
