Streptococcus gordonii Grampositive bacterium included among initial colonizers periodontal environment. The organism, along related oral streptococci, high affinity molecules salivary pellicle coating tooth surfaces. S. gordonii therefore rapidly colonize clean tooth surfaces, S. gordonii along related organisms comprise high percentage, , bacterial biofilm forms clean tooth surfaces. Generally harmless mouth, S. gordonii cause acute bacterial endocarditis upon gaining access systemically. S. gordonii also forms attachment substratum later colonizers tooth surface modulate pathogenicity secondary colonizers interspecies communication mechanisms. The whole genome sequence S. gordonii CCUG type strain deposited published DNA Data Bank Japan, European Nucleotide Archive GenBank accession number LQWV. This Streptococcaceaerelated article stub.
