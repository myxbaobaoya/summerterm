In taxonomy binomial nomenclature "twoterm naming system" also called binominal nomenclature "twoname naming system" binary nomenclature formal system naming species living things giving name composed two parts use Latin grammatical forms although based words languages Such name called binomial name may shortened "binomial" binomen binominal name scientific name informally also called Latin name The first part name – generic name – identifies genus species belongs whereas second part – specific name specific epithet – distinguishes species within genus For example modern humans belong genus Homo within genus species Homo sapiens Tyrannosaurus rex probably widely known binomial The formal introduction system naming species credited Carl Linnaeus effectively beginning work Species Plantarum But early Gaspard Bauhin introduced book Pinax theatri botanici English Illustrated exposition plants many names genera later adopted Linnaeus The application binomial nomenclature governed various internationally agreed codes rules two important International Code Zoological Nomenclature ICZN animals International Code Nomenclature algae fungi plants ICNafp Although general principles underlying binomial nomenclature common two codes differences terminology use particular rules In modern usage first letter generic name always capitalized writing specific epithet even derived proper noun name person place Similarly parts italicized normal text underlined handwriting Thus binomial name annual phlox named botanist Thomas Drummond written Phlox drummondii Often species name introduced text generic name abbreviated first letter subsequent mentions e g P drummondii In scientific works authority binomial name usually given least first mentioned year publication may specified The name composed two wordforming elements bi Latin prefix meaning two nomial literally name In Medieval Latin related word binomium used signify one term binomial expression mathematics The word nomen plural nomina means name Latin Prior adoption modern binomial system naming species scientific name consisted generic name combined specific name one several words long Together formed system polynomial nomenclature These names two separate functions First designate label species second diagnosis description however two goals eventually found incompatible In simple genus containing two species easy tell apart oneword genus oneword specific name species discovered names necessarily became longer unwieldy instance Plantago foliis ovatolanceolatus pubescentibus spica cylindrica scapo tereti "plantain pubescent ovatelanceolate leaves cylindric spike terete scape" know today Plantago media Such "polynomial names" may sometimes look like binomials significantly different For example Gerards herbal amended Johnson describes various kinds spiderwort "The first called Phalangium ramosum Branched Spiderwort second Phalangium non ramosum Unbranched Spiderwort The aptly termed Phalangium Ephemerum Virginianum SoonFading Spiderwort Virginia" The Latin phrases short descriptions rather identifying labels The Bauhins particular Caspar Bauhin – took important steps towards binomial system pruning Latin descriptions many cases two words The adoption biologists system strictly binomial nomenclature due Swedish botanist physician Carl Linnaeus – It Linnaeuss Species Plantarum began consistently using oneword trivial name nomen triviale generic name genus name system binomial nomenclature Trivial names already appeared Critica Botanica Philosophia Botanica This trivial name known specific epithet ICNafp specific name ICZN The Bauhins genus names retained many descriptive part reduced single word Linnaeuss trivial names introduced important new idea namely function name could simply give species unique label This meant name longer need descriptive example parts could derived names people Thus Gerards Phalangium ephemerum virginianum became Tradescantia virginiana genus name honoured John Tradescant Youngernote English botanist gardener A bird parrot family named Psittacus alexandri meaning "Alexanders parrot" Alexander Great whose armies introduced eastern parakeets Greece Linnaeuss trivial names much easier remember use parallel polynomial names eventually replaced The value binomial nomenclature system derives primarily economy widespread use uniqueness stability names Codes Zoological Botanical Bacterial Viral Nomenclature provide Binomial nomenclature species effect species moved one genus another sometimes specific name epithet must changed well This may happen specific name already used new genus agree gender new genus specific epithet adjective modifying genus name Some biologists argued combination genus name specific epithet single unambiguous name use uninomials used nomenclature ranks species Because genus names unique within nomenclature code possible two species share genus name even binomial occur different kingdoms At least instances genus name duplication occur mainly zoology botany Nomenclature including binomial nomenclature classification although two related Classification ordering items groups based similarities differences biological classification species one kinds item classified In principle names given species could completely independent classification This case binomial names since first part binomial name genus species placed Above rank genus binomial nomenclature classification partly independent example species retains binomial name moved one family another one order another unless better fits different genus different family split old genus placed newly created genus The independence partial since names families higher taxa usually based generacitation needed Taxonomy includes nomenclature classification Its first stages sometimes called "alpha taxonomy" concerned finding describing naming species living fossil organisms Binomial nomenclature thus important part taxonomy system species named Taxonomists also concerned classification including principles procedures rules A complete binomial name always treated grammatically phrase Latin language hence common use term "Latin name" binomial name However two parts binomial name derived number sources Latin one These include The first part name identifies genus must word treated Latin singular noun nominative case It must unique within purview nomenclatural code repeated Thus Huia recurvata extinct species plant found fossils Yunnan China whereas Huia masonii species frog found Java Indonesia The second part name identifies species within genus also treated grammatically Latin word It one number forms Whereas first part binomial name must unique within purview nomenclatural code second part quite commonly used two genera shown examples hodgsonii The full binomial name must unique within code From early th century onwards became ever apparent body rules necessary govern scientific names In course time became nomenclature codes The International Code Zoological Nomenclature ICZN governs naming animals International Code Nomenclature algae fungi plants ICNafp plants including cyanobacteria International Code Nomenclature Bacteria ICNB bacteria including Archaea Virus names governed International Committee Taxonomy Viruses ICTV taxonomic code determines taxa well names These codes differ certain ways eg Unifying different codes single code "BioCode" suggested although implementation sight There also published code different system biotic nomenclature use ranks species instead names clades This called PhyloCode As noted differences codes way binomials formed example ICZN allows parts ICNafp Another difference way personal names used forming specific names epithets The ICNafp sets precise rules personal name converted specific epithet In particular names ending consonant "er" treated first converted Latin adding "ius" man "ia" woman made genitive ie meaning "of person persons" This produces specific epithets like lecardii Lecard male wilsoniae Wilson female brauniarum Braun sisters By contrast ICZN require intermediate creation Latin form personal name allowing genitive ending added directly personal name This explains difference names plant Magnolia hodgsonii bird Anthus hodgsoni Furthermore ICNafp requires names published form required code corrected conform whereas ICZN protective form used original author By tradition binomial names species usually typeset italics example Homo sapiens Generally binomial printed font style different used normal text example "Several Homo sapiens fossils discovered" When handwritten binomial name underlined example Homo sapiens The first part binomial genus name always written initial capital letter Older sources particularly botanical works published use different convention If second part name derived proper noun eg name person place capital letter used Thus modern form Berberis darwinii written Berberis Darwinii A capital also used name formed two nouns apposition eg Panthera Leo Centaurea Cyanusnote In current usage second part never written initial capital When used common name scientific name often follows parentheses although varies publication For example "The house sparrow Passer domesticus decreasing Europe" The binomial name generally written full The exception several species genus listed discussed paper report species mentioned repeatedly case genus written full first used may abbreviated initial periodfull stop For example list members genus Canis might written "Canis lupus C aureus C simensis" In rare cases abbreviated form spread general use example bacterium Escherichia coli often referred E coli Tyrannosaurus rex perhaps even better known simply T rex two often appearing form popular writing even full genus name already given The abbreviation "sp" used actual specific name cannot need specified The abbreviation "spp" plural indicates "several species" These abbreviations italicised underlined For example "Canis sp" means "an unspecified species genus Canis" "Canis spp" means "two species genus Canis" These abbreviations confused abbreviations "ssp" zoology "subsp" botany plurals "sspp" "subspp" referring one subspecies See trinomen zoology infraspecific name The abbreviation "cf" ie confer Latin used compare individualstaxa knowndescribed species Conventions use "cf" qualifier vary In paleontology typically used identification confirmed For example "Corvus cf nasicus" used indicate "a fossil bird similar Cuban crow certainly identified species" In molecular systematics papers "cf" may used indicate one undescribed species assumed related described species For example paper describing phylogeny small benthic freshwater fish called darters five undescribed putative species Ozark Sheltowee Wildcat Ihiyo Mamequit darters notable brightly colored nuptial males distinctive color patterns referred "Etheostoma cf spectabile" viewed related distinct Etheostoma spectabile orangethroat darter This view supported varying degrees DNA analysis The somewhat informal use taxa names qualifying abbreviations referred open nomenclature subject strict usage codes In contexts dagger symbol "†" may used binomial name indicate species extinct In scholarly texts least first main use binomial name usually followed "authority" – way designating scientists first published name The authority written slightly different ways zoology botany For names governed ICZN surname usually written full together date normally year publication The ICZN recommends "original author date name cited least work dealing taxon denoted name" For names governed ICNafp name generally reduced standard abbreviation date omitted The International Plant Names Index maintains approved list botanical author abbreviations Historically abbreviations used zoology When original name changed eg species moved different genus codes use parentheses around original authority ICNafp also requires person made change given In ICNafp original name called basionym Some examples Binomial nomenclature described system naming species Implicitly includes system naming genera since first part name species genus name In classification system based ranks also ways naming ranks level genus level species Ranks genus eg family order class receive onepart names conventionally written italics Thus house sparrow Passer domesticus belongs family Passeridae Family names normally based genus names although endings used differ zoology botany Ranks species receive threepart names conventionally written italics like names species There significant differences ICZN ICNafp In zoology rank species subspecies name written simply three parts trinomen Thus one subspecies olivebacked pipit Anthus hodgsoni berezowskii In botany many ranks species although name written three parts "connecting term" part name needed show rank Thus American black elder Sambucus nigra subsp canadensis whiteflowered form ivyleaved cyclamen Cyclamen hederifolium f albiflorum
