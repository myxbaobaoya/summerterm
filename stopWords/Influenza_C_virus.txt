Influenza C virus species genus Gammainfluenzavirus virus family Orthomyxoviridae like influenza viruses causes influenza Influenza C viruses known infect humans pigs Flu due Type C species rare compared Types B A severe cause local epidemics Type C RNA segments encodes proteins Types A B RNA segments encode least proteins Influenza viruses members family Orthomyxoviridae Influenza viruses A B C D represent four antigenic types influenza viruses Of four antigenic types influenza A virus severe influenza B virus less severe still cause outbreaks influenza C virus usually associated minor symptoms Influenza D virus similar amino acid composition influenza C virus similar level divergence types A B types C D much greater level divergence types A B Influenza viruses C D estimated diverged common ancestor years ago around AD Influenza viruses A B estimated diverged single ancestor around years ago ancestor influenza viruses A B ancestor influenza virus C estimated diverged common ancestor around years ago Influenza A virus infect variety animals well humans natural reservoir natural host birds whereas influenza viruses B C D animal reservoirs Influenza C virus easily isolated less information known type studies show occurs worldwide Influenza C virus currently lineages estimated emerged around AD This virus may spread person person respiratory droplets fomites nonliving material due ability survive surfaces short durations Influenza viruses relatively short incubation period lapse time exposure pathogen appearance symptoms – hours infect epithelial cells respiratory tract Influenza virus C tends cause mild upper respiratory infections Coldlike symptoms associated virus including fever – °C dry cough rhinorrhea nasal discharge headache muscle pain achiness The virus may lead severe infections bronchitis pneumonia After individual becomes infected immune system develops antibodies infectious agent This bodys main source protection Most children five ten years old already produced antibodies influenza virus C As influenza viruses type C affects individuals ages severe young children elderly individuals underlying health problems Young children less prior exposure developed antibodies elderly less effective immune systems Influenza virus infections one highest preventable mortalities many countries world Influenza viruses like viruses family Orthomyxoviridae enveloped RNA viruses single stranded genomes The antigens matrix protein M nucleoprotein NP used determine influenza virus type A B C D The M protein required virus assembly NP functions transcription replication These viruses also contain proteins surface cell membrane called glycoproteins Type A B two glycoproteins hemagglutinin HA neuraminidase NA Types C D one glycoprotein hemagglutininesterase fusion HEF These glycoproteins allow attachment fusion viral cellular membranes Fusion membranes allows viral proteins genome released host cell causes infection Types C D influenza viruses express enzyme esterase This enzyme similar enzyme neuraminidase produced Types A B function destroying host cell receptors Glycoproteins may undergo mutations antigenic drift reassortment new HA NA produced antigenic shift Influenza virus C capable antigenic drift whereas Type A undergoes antigenic shift well When either processes occur antibodies formed immune system longer protect altered glycoproteins Because viruses continually cause infections Influenza virus C different Types A B growth requirements Because isolated identified frequently Diagnosis virus isolation serology tests Hemagglutination inhibition HI one method serology detects antibodies diagnostic purposes Western blot immunoblot assay enzymelinked immunosorbent assay ELISA two methods used detect proteins antigens serum In techniques antibodies protein interest added presence specific protein indicated color change ELISA shown higher sensitivity HEF HI test Because Influenza viruses C D produce esterase In Situ Esterase Assays provide quick inexpensive method detecting Types C D If individuals tested Influenza virus C well three types infections previously associated Type C may recognized Because influenza virus A animal reservoir contains known subtypes undergo antigenic shift type influenza virus capable producing pandemics Influenza viruses A B also cause seasonal epidemics almost every year due ability antigenic drift Influenza virus C capability thought significant concern human health Therefore vaccinations influenza virus C
