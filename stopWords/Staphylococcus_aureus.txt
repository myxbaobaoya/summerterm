Staphylococcus aureus Grampositive roundshaped bacterium member Bacillota usual member microbiota body frequently found upper respiratory tract skin It often positive catalase nitrate reduction facultative anaerobe grow without need oxygen Although S aureus usually acts commensal human microbiota also become opportunistic pathogen common cause skin infections including abscesses respiratory

toxic shock syndrome bacteremia sepsis It still one five common causes hospitalacquired infections often cause wound infections following surgery Each year around patients hospitals United States contract staphylococcal infection chiefly S aureus Up deaths year United States linked S aureus infections In Alexander Ogston Scottish surgeon discovered Staphylococcus cause wound infections noticing groups bacteria pus surgical abscess procedure performing He named Staphylococcus clustered appearance evident microscope Then German scientist Friedrich Julius Rosenbach identified Staphylococcus aureus discriminating separating Staphylococcus albus related bacterium In early doctors began use streamlined test detect presence S aureus infection means coagulase testing enables detection enzyme produced bacterium Prior S aureus infections fatal majority patients However doctors discovered use penicillin could cure S aureus infections Unfortunately end penicillin resistance became widespread amongst bacterium population outbreaks resistant strain began occur Staphylococcus aureus sorted ten dominant human lineages There numerous minor lineages well seen population often Genomes bacteria within lineage mostly conserved exception mobile genetic elements Mobile genetic elements common S aureus include bacteriophages pathogenicity islands plasmids transposons staphylococcal cassette chromosomes These elements enabled S aureus continually evolve gain new traits There great deal genetic variation within S aureus species A study Fitzgerald et al revealed approximately S aureus genome noncoding thus differ bacterium bacterium An example difference seen species virulence Only strains S aureus associated infections humans This demonstrates large range infectious ability within species It proposed one possible reason great deal heterogeneity within species could due reliance heterogeneous infections This occurs multiple different types S aureus cause infection within host The different strains secrete different enzymes bring different antibiotic resistances group increasing pathogenic ability Thus need large number mutations acquisitions mobile genetic elements Another notable evolutionary process within S aureus species coevolution human hosts Over time parasitic relationship led bacteriums ability carried nasopharynx humans without

leads scientists believe many factors determine whether S aureus carried asymptomatically humans including factors specific individual person According study Hofman et al factors may include age sex
