Individual cells slender, rodshaped bacilli pointed ends. Strains Fusobacterium cause several human diseases, including periodontal diseases, Lemierre's syndrome, topical skin ulcers. Although older sources state Fusobacterium part normal flora human oropharynx, current consensus Fusobacterium always treated pathogen. F. prausnitzii, gut commensal associated healthy patients, completely reclassified Faecalibacterium Clostridiales:Ruminococcaceae . In , researchers discovered Fusobacterium flourishes colon cancer cells, often also associated ulcerative colitis, although researchers determined organism actually causes diseases simply flourishes environment diseases create. The bacterium big anchor biofilms. It susceptible clindamycin. In contrast Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium potent lipopolysaccharide.
