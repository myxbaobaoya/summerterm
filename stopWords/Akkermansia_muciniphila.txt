Akkermansia muciniphila species human intestinal mucindegrading bacterium, type species new genus, Akkermansia, proposed Muriel Derrien Willem de Vos.: Extensive research undertaken understand association obesity, type diabetes, inflammation. A. muciniphila Gramnegative, strictly anaerobic, nonmotile, nonsporeforming, ovalshaped bacterium. Its type strain MucT ATCC BAAT CIP T. A. muciniphila able use mucin sole source carbon nitrogen, culturable anaerobic conditions medium containing gastric mucin, able colonize gastrointestinal tracts number animal species. Recently, A. muciniphila strain Urmite became first evidently unculturable bacterial strain sequenced entirety entirely human stool sample. A. muciniphila believed antiinflammatory effects humans, studies shown inverse relationships A. muciniphila colonization inflammatory conditions appendicitis inflammatory bowel disease IBD. In one study, reduced levels A. muciniphila correlated increased severity appendicitis. In separate study, IBD patients found lower levels A. muciniphila intestinal tract individuals without IBD. Researchers discovered A. muciniphila could used combat obesity type diabetes. The first study carried mice, overfed contain three times fat lean cousin. The obese mice fed bacteria, shown reduce fat burden mice half without change mice's diet. This effect associated restoration proper gut barrier function, means absence leakage inflammatory bacterial compounds blood. Interestingly, study, authors found bacteria killed high temperature autoclaving, bacteria unable improve metabolic response. A study published June showed association A. muciniphila abundance, insulin sensitivity, healthier metabolic status overweightobese adults. The healthier subjects high A. muciniphila abundance gut microbial richness. In addition, study showed higher abundance A. muciniphila baseline associated greater clinical benefits weight loss. The bacterium naturally present human digestive tract , seen fall obesity. In August , additional research demonstrated dietary fats influence growth Akkermansia muciniphilia relative bacterium dietary tract. Researchers conducted study mice fed diets varied fat composition otherwise identical: one group received lard, received fish oil. After weeks, group receiving fish oil diet increased levels A. muciniphila bacterium genus Lactobacillus, group receiving lard diet decreased levels A. muciniphila Lactobacillus. Additionally, fecal material mice fish oil diet lard based diet transplanted new group mice native gut flora eradicated antibiotics. All mice fed lard based diet. Despite receiving lardbased diet weeks, recipients transplants lardfed donor mice showed increased levels Lactobacillus increased levels inflammation, recipients transplants fish oilfed donors showed increased levels A. muciniphila decreased levels inflammation. Researchers concluded increase A. muciniphila corresponded reduction inflammation, indicating link dietary fats, gut flora composition, inflammation levels. In , discovered pasteurizing Â°C min bacteria increased beneficial effects bacteria mechanism likely associated presence protein present outer membrane Akkermansia muciniphila called Amuc. Then , team Belgian researchers UCLouvain tested first time humans impact oral supplementation either A. muciniphila alive pasteurized versus placebo months. In doubleblind placebocontrolled proofofconcept study, found overweight obese insulin resistant subjects displayed improved metabolism lower blood insulin, lower insulin resistance, lower inflammation better cardiometabolic profile. More recently, linked effect possible increased production endocannabinoids acting receptor PPARa. One study looked patients lung kidney cancer, A. muciniphila patients respond compared third not. Boosting levels A. muciniphila mice seemed also boost response immunotherapy. Researchers discovered mouse model Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis suffers abnormal gut microbiome, supplementing mice Akkermansia muciniphila improved symptoms, slowed progression disease, increased survival. Moreover, found A. muciniphila produce vitamin nicotinamide, injected diseased mice improved motor symptoms, although increase lifespan bacteria had. They also found lower levels nicotinamide circulation cerebrospinal fluid CSF small sample human ALS patients compared family members, lower levels A. muciniphila stool. In addition, ALS patients lower levels nicotinamide blood tended worse symptoms patients higher levels.
