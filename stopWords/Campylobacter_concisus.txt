Campylobacter concisus Gramnegative, highly fastidious, mesophilic bacterium grows anaerobic microaerobic conditions presence hydrogen significantly aiding growth. Motile, either unipolar bipolar flagella, organisms characteristic spiralcorkscrew appearance oxidasepositive. Although human oral cavity natural colonization site bacterium, C. concisus may also colonize intestinal tract individuals. In particular, several studies reported higher intestinal prevalence C. concisus patients IBD compared healthy controls, led current speculation bacterium's implication induction Crohn's disease. A number studies defined C. concisus composed two phenotypically identical, yet genomically distinct genomospecies analysis amplified fragment length polymorphisms AFLP, housekeeping genes PCR method targeting polymorphisms C. concisus S rRNA gene. The two genomospecies appear harbor different levels enteric pathogenic potential, oral C. concisus strains invasive human epithelial cell line Caco found Genomospecies GS. Recently, C. concisus molecular marker csep, particularly csep gene sixnucleotide insertion csepbpi found associated active Crohn's disease, pSma plasmid found associated severe ulcerative colitis. The csep gene located either pICON plasmid chromosome.
