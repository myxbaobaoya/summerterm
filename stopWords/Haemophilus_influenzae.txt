Haemophilus influenzae formerly called Pfeiffer's bacillus Bacillus influenzae Gramnegative, coccobacillary, facultatively anaerobic capnophilic pathogenic bacterium family Pasteurellaceae. H. influenzae first described Richard Pfeiffer influenza pandemic. He incorrectly described Haemophilus influenzae causative microbe, retains "influenza" name. The bacterium argued cause influenza bacterial influenza. H. influenzae responsible wide range localized invasive infections, influenza caused viruses. This species first freeliving organism entire genome sequenced. In , two major categories H. influenzae defined: unencapsulated strains encapsulated strains. Encapsulated strains classified basis distinct capsular antigens. The six generally recognized types encapsulated H. influenzae are: a, b, c, d, e, f. Genetic diversity among unencapsulated strains greater within encapsulated group. Unencapsulated strains termed nontypable NTHi lack capsular serotypes; however, classified multilocus sequence typing. The pathogenesis H. influenzae infections completely understood, although presence polyribosyl ribitol phosphate PRP capsule encapsulated type b Hib, serotype causing conditions epiglottitis, known major factor virulence. Their capsule allows resist phagocytosis complementmediated lysis nonimmune host. The unencapsulated strains almost always less invasive; can, however, produce inflammatory response humans, lead many symptoms. Vaccination Hib conjugate vaccine effective preventing Hib infection prevent infection NTHi strains. Most strains H. influenzae opportunistic pathogens; is, usually live host without causing disease, cause problems factors viral infection, reduced immune function chronically inflamed tissues, e.g. allergies create opportunity. They infect host sticking host cell using trimeric autotransporter adhesins. Naturally acquired disease caused H. influenzae seems occur humans only. In infants young children, H. influenzae type b Hib causes bacteremia, pneumonia, epiglottitis acute bacterial meningitis. On occasion, causes cellulitis, osteomyelitis, infectious arthritis. It one cause neonatal infection. Due routine use Hib vaccine U.S. since , incidence invasive Hib disease decreased ., children. However, Hib remains major cause lower respiratory tract infections infants children developing countries vaccine widely used. Unencapsulated H. influenzae strains unaffected Hib vaccine cause ear infections otitis media, eye infections conjunctivitis, sinusitis children, associated pneumonia. Clinical features may include initial symptoms upper respiratory tract infection mimicking viral infection, usually associated fevers, often lowgrade. This may progress lower respiratory tract days, features often resembling wheezy bronchitis. Sputum may difficult expectorate often grey creamy color. The cough may persist weeks without appropriate treatment. Many cases diagnosed presenting chest infections respond penicillins firstgeneration cephalosporins. A chest Xray identify alveolar consolidation. Clinical diagnosis H. influenzae typically performed bacterial culture latex particle agglutinations. Diagnosis considered confirmed organism isolated sterile body site. In respect, H. influenzae cultured nasopharyngeal cavity sputum would indicate H. influenzae disease, sites colonized diseasefree individuals. However, H. influenzae isolated cerebrospinal fluid blood would indicate H. influenzae infection. Bacterial culture H. influenzae performed agar plates, preferable one chocolate agar, added X hemin V nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide factors Â°C COenriched incubator. Blood agar growth achieved satellite phenomenon around bacteria. Colonies H. influenzae appear convex, smooth, pale, grey, transparent colonies.citation needed Gram stained microscopic observation specimen H. influenzae show Gramnegative coccobacillus. The cultured organism characterized using catalase oxidase tests, positive. Further serological testing necessary distinguish capsular polysaccharide differentiate H. influenzae b nonencapsulated species.citation needed Although highly specific, bacterial culture H. influenzae lacks sensitivity. Use antibiotics prior sample collection greatly reduces isolation rate killing bacteria identification possible. Beyond this, H. influenzae finicky bacterium culture, modification culture procedures greatly reduce isolation rates. Poor quality laboratories developing countries resulted poor isolation rates H. influenzae.citation needed. Recent work shown H.influenzae uses highly specialised spectrum nutrients lactate preferred carbon source. H. influenzae grow hemolytic zone Staphylococcus aureus blood agar plates; hemolysis cells S. aureus releases factor V needed growth. H. influenzae grow outside hemolytic zone S. aureus due lack nutrients factor V areas. Fildes agar best isolation. In Levinthal medium, capsulated strains show distinctive iridescence. The latex particle agglutination test LAT sensitive method detect H. influenzae culture. Because method relies antigen rather viable bacteria, results disrupted prior antibiotic use. It also added benefit much quicker culture methods. However, antibiotic sensitivity testing possible LAT alone, parallel culture necessary.citation needed Polymerase chain reaction PCR assays proven sensitive either LAT culture tests, highly specific. However, PCR assays yet become routine clinical settings. Countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis shown effective research diagnostic method largely supplanted PCR. Both H. influenzae S. pneumoniae found upper respiratory system humans. In vitro study competition, S. pneumoniae always overpowered H. influenzae attacking hydrogen peroxide stripping surface molecules H. influenzae needs survival. When bacteria placed together nasal cavity, within two weeks, H. influenzae survives. When either placed separately nasal cavity, one survives. Upon examining upper respiratory tissue mice exposed bacteria species, extraordinarily large number neutrophils immune cells found. In mice exposed one species, neutrophils present. Lab tests showed neutrophils exposed dead H. influenzae aggressive attacking S. pneumoniae unexposed neutrophils. Exposure dead H. influenzae effect live H. influenzae. Two scenarios may responsible response: It unclear H. influenzae affected immune response. Haemophilus influenzae cause respiratory tract infections including pneumonia, otitis media, epiglottitis swelling throat, eye infections bloodstream infection, meningitis. It also cause cellulitis skin infection infectious arthritis inflammation joint. Haemophilus influenzae produces betalactamases, also able modify penicillinbinding proteins, gained resistance penicillin family antibiotics. In severe cases, cefotaxime ceftriaxone delivered directly bloodstream elected antibiotics, and, less severe cases, association ampicillin sulbactam, cephalosporins second third generation, fluoroquinolones preferred. Fluoroquinoloneresistant Haemophilus influenzae observed. Macrolides fluoroquinolones activity nontypeable H. influenzae could used patients history allergy betalactam antibiotics. However, macrolide resistance also observed. The serious complications HiB brain damage, hearing loss, even death. This commonly associated HiB however Hi nontypable often cause serious conditions risks chronic infection ability change surface antigens. Chronic infections usually serious acute infections. Effective vaccines Haemophilus influenzae Type B available since early s, recommended children age asplenic patients. The World Health Organization recommends pentavalent vaccine, combining vaccines diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B Hib. There yet sufficient evidence effective pentavalent vaccine relation individual vaccines. Hib vaccines cost seven times total cost vaccines measles, polio, tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis. Consequently, whereas populations developed countries vaccinated Hib , vaccination coverage developing countries, leastdeveloped countries. The Hib vaccines provide crossprotection Haemophilus influenzae serotypes like Hia, Hic, Hid, Hie Hif. An oral vaccination developed nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae NTHi patients chronic bronchitis shown effective reducing number severity COPD exacerbations. However, effective vaccine types capsulated Haemophilus inflenzae Haemophilus inflenzae nontypeable. H. influenzae first freeliving organism entire genome sequenced. Completed Craig Venter team The Institute Genomic Research, part J. Craig Venter Institute. Haemophilus chosen one project leaders, Nobel laureate Hamilton Smith, working decades able provide highquality DNA libraries. The genome strain Rd KW consists ,, base pairs DNA single circular chromosome contains proteincoding genes, pseudogenes, tRNA genes, RNA genes. The sequencing method used wholegenome shotgun, completed published Science . Unencapsulated H. influenzae often observed airways patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD. Neutrophils also observed large numbers sputum patients COPD. The neutrophils phagocytize H. influenzae, thereby activating oxidative respiratory burst. However instead killing bacteria neutrophils killed though oxidative burst likely causes DNA damage H. influenzae cells. Dearth killing bacteria appears explain persistence infection COPD. H. influenzae mutants defective rec gene homolog recA sensitive killing oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide. This finding suggests rec expression important H. influenzae survival conditions oxidative stress. Since homolog recA, rec likely plays key role recombinational repair DNA damage. Thus H. influenzae may protect genome reactive oxygen species produced host's phagocytic cells recombinational repair oxidative DNA damages. Recombinational repair damaged site chromosome requires, addition rec, second homologous undamaged DNA molecule. Individual H. influenzae cells capable taking homologous DNA cells process transformation. Transformation H. influenzae involves least gene products, likely adaptation repairing DNA damage resident chromosome.citation needed Vaccines target unencapsulated H. influenzae serotypes development.
