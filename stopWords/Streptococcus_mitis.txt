Streptococcus mitior Streptococcus mitis mesophilic alphahemolytic species Streptococcus inhabits oral cavity. It coccus spherical shaped, grampositive, catalase negative, facultative anaerobe. It previously classified Streptococcus mitior. Streptococcus mitis known cause several medical conditions one infective endocarditis. Members Streptococcus genera belong lactic acid bacteria defined formation lactic acid endproduct carbohydrate metabolism. The family Streptococcaceae characterized based upon S rRNA gene sequence analysis within low mol GC branch. There species genus classified S rRNA sequences. Streptococcus mitis primarily resides oral cavity includes mouth, nasopharynx, throat. However, also cases female genital tract, gastrointestinal tract, even integumentary system. S. mitis competent natural genetic transformation. Thus S. mitis cells able take exogenous DNA incorporate exogenous sequence information genome homologous recombination. These bacteria employ predatory fratricidal mechanism active acquisition homologous DNA. It reported Streptococcus mitis identified survived two years Surveyor probe Moon. However, many NASA scientists speculate probably due contamination upon return Earth. The Apollo crew received pieces Surveyor , one TV camera. The probe analyzed consider lunar environment affected material. Surveyor sterilized launch scientists wanted see organisms could survive two half years moon, looking surviving organic material part analysis. Upon inspection, group found amount S. mitis inside piece foam located inside camera. Culture plates made identity later confirmed Streptococcus mitis US Communicable Disease Center Atlanta, Georgia. At first, speculated S. mitis picked moon research later discovered residence bacteria probe started probe returned. This bacillirelated article stub. You help Wikipedia expanding it.
