Lymphocytic choriomeningitis LCM rodentborne viral infectious disease presents aseptic meningitis encephalitis meningoencephalitis Its causative agent lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus LCMV member family Arenaviridae The name coined Charles Armstrong Lymphocytic choriomeningitis LCM "a viral infection membranes surrounding brain spinal cord cerebrospinal fluid" The name based tendency individual abnormally high levels lymphocytes infection Choriomeningitis "cerebral meningitis marked cellular infiltration meninges often lymphocytic infiltration choroid plexuses" LCMV infection manifests wide range clinical symptoms may even asymptomatic immunocompetent individuals Onset typically occurs one two weeks exposure virus followed biphasic febrile illness During initial prodromal phase may last week common symptoms include fever lack appetite headache muscle aches malaise nausea andor vomiting Less frequent symptoms include sore throat cough well joint chest parotid pain The onset second phase occurs several days recovery consists symptoms meningitis encephalitis Pathological findings first stage consist leukopenia thrombocytopenia During second phase typical findings include elevated protein levels increased leukocyte count decrease glucose levels cerebrospinal fluid Occasionally patient improves days relapses aseptic meningitis rarely meningoencephalitis Patients meningitis may stiff neck fever headache myalgia nausea malaise In occasions meningitis occurs without prodromal syndrome Meningoencephalitis characterized profound neurological signs confusion drowsiness sensory abnormalities motor signs Under reported complications include myelitis Guillain–Barrétype syndrome cranial nerve palsies transient permanent hydrocephalus sensorineural hearing loss orchitis arthritis parotitis LCMV infections also associated pancreatitis pneumonitis myocarditis pericarditis The entire illness usually lasts weeks nonetheless temporary permanent neurological damage possible central nervous system infections especially cases meningoencephalitis Chronic infections reported humans deaths rarely occur There several strains LCM virus among widely used LCMV Armstrong LCMV Clone Armstrong original virus strain isolated brain Charles Armstrong It triggers vigorous cytotoxic T lymphocytesCTL response thus cleared rapidly host This referred acute Armstrong LCMV infection On hand Clone variant Armstrong viral strain isolated spleen consequently tropic visceral organs It first isolated mice sustained persistent LCMV infection birth This variant potentiates less vigorous CTL response immune system thus ultimately persist host organism indefinitely The latter referred chronic Clone LCMV infection LCMV spherical enveloped virus diameter nm The helical nucleocapsid contains RNA genome consisting two negative singlestranded RNA segments The negative RNA strand complementary necessary mRNA strand indicates must first transcribed positive mRNA strand translated required proteins The L strand ambisense RNA encoding multiple proteins opposite directions separated intergenic region It approximately kb size encodes highmolecularmass protein L kDa kDa small polypeptide Z unknown function ring finger motif The viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase encoded L protein contains conserved characteristic motifs throughout RNAdependent RNApolymerases The S strand ambisense approximately kb size It encodes two main structural proteins nucleoprotein NP kDa glycoprotein precursor complex GPC kDa The latter undergoes posttranslational cleavage two separate steps first endoplasmic reticulum following translation membrane stable signal peptide region cleaved signal peptidase SPase notably signal peptide retained contrast viruses The second cleavage occurs Golgi apparatus GPGP trafficked Golgi cleaved separate mature viral glycoproteins GP GP cleavage mediated SKPS MTBPS The spikes present virion envelope dictated tetramer formation GP GP When LCMV attacks cell process replication starts attachment virus host receptors surface glycoproteins It endocytosed vesicle inside host cell creates fusion virus vesicle membranes The ribonucleocapsid released cytoplasm The RNAdependent RNApolymerase brought along virus initially binds promoter L S segments begins transcription negativestranded positivestranded mRNA The formation strong hairpin sequence end gene terminates transcription The mRNA strands capped RNAdependent RNApolymerase cytoplasm subsequently translated four proteins essential LCMV assembly The ribonucleocapsid interacts Z matrix protein buds cell membrane releasing virion infected cell The first arenavirus Lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus LCMV isolated Charles Armstrong study epidemic St Louis Although cause outbreak LCMV found cause nonbacterial aseptic meningitiscitation needed In Peter Doherty Rolf Zinkernagel shared Nobel Prize Medicine Physiology work LCMV led fundamental understanding adaptive immune response MHC restriction In studies concerning importance MHC locus done exclusively transplantation tumor rejection Taking consideration Doherty Zinkernagel working response mice virus infections They observed Tcell receptors must recognise complex foreign antigen MHC antigen order destroy infected cells Their key experiment involved harvesting splenocytes containing LCMVspecific cytotoxic T lymphocytesCTL infected mouse strain A These mixed vitro virus infected fibroblasts macrophages two different mouse strains A B By method Crrelease cytotoxicity assay thereby tagging CTL chromium Cr CTL destruction infected cells quantified release Cr The results showed CTL killed infected cells strain A lyse uninfected cells infected cells strain B They concluded virus specific CTLs lyse cells carrying molecules major histocompatibility site MHC CTLs Thus virusspecific CTLs "MHCrestricted" This discovery lead greater understanding important aspect immune systemcitation needed LCMV naturally spread common house mouse Mus musculus Once infected mice become chronically infected maintaining virus blood persistently shedding virus urine Chronically infected female mice usually transmit infection offspring vertical transmission turn become chronically infected Other modes mousetomouse transmission include nasal secretions milk infected dams bites social grooming within mouse communities Airborne transmission also occurs The virus seems relatively resistant drying therefore humans become infected inhaling infectious aerosolized particles rodent urine feces saliva ingesting food contaminated virus contamination mucous membranes infected body fluids directly exposing cuts open wounds virusinfected blood The documented cases transmission animals occurred humans mice hamsterscitation needed Cases lymphocytic choriomeningitis reported North South America Europe Australia Japan particularly However infection may occur wherever infected rodent host population exists LCMV occurs worldwide natural host rodent become established continents except Antarctica Seroprevalence approximately – US population It tends common among lower socioeconomic groupings probably reflecting frequent direct contacts mice However obtaining accurate sense prevalence geographic region difficult due underreporting Lymphocytic choriomeningitis particular concern obstetrics vertical transmission known occur For immunocompetent mothers significant threat virus damaging effects upon fetus If infection occurs first trimester LCMV results increased risk spontaneous abortion Later congenital infection may lead malformations intracranial calcifications hydrocephalus microcephaly macrocephaly intellectual disabilities seizures Other findings include chorioretinal scars optic atrophy Chorioretinitis followed chorioretinal scarring common ocular lesion Mortality among infants approximately Among survivors twothirds lasting neurologic abnormalities Other ocular defects including optic atrophy microphthalmia vitreitis leukokoria cataracts also seen Most infants one case series normal birth weight although underweight Aspiration pneumonia fatal complication Infants survive may severe neurological defects including epilepsy impaired coordination visual loss blindness spastic diplegia quadriparesisquadriplegia delayed development intellectual disability Less severe cases isolated cerebellar hypoplasia symptoms ataxia jitteriness reported occasionally There also rare cases evidence

disinfectants including sodium hypochlorite ethanol glutaraldehyde formaldehyde The effectiveness infection quickly declines pH pH In addition LCMV also inactivated heat ultraviolet light gamma irradiation Studies indicated human infection virus occurs primarily fall winter months presumably due movement mice indoors Several measures taken prevent exposure LCM wild rodents home A checklist precautions provided Centers Disease Control Prevention providing tips sealing home keep rodents using traps eliminate existing rodents maintaining clean healthy home New technology reflects growing trend humane means eliminating rodents Products include devices emit ultrasonic sound allegedly irritates mice drives away swift painless means death mini electrocution gas chambers However traditional snap trap remains economic popular option Treatment symptomatic supportive Children hydrocephalus often need ventriculoperitoneal shunt Nucleoside analog ribavirin used cases due inhibitory effect agent vitro arenaviruses However sufficient evidence efficacy humans support routine use The survivor transplantassociated LCMV infection treated ribavirin simultaneous tapering immunosuppressive medications Early intravenous ribavirin treatment required maximal efficacy produce considerable side effects Ribavirin evaluated yet controlled clinical trialscitation needed Use ribavirin pregnancy generally recommended studies indicate possibility teratogenic effects If aseptic meningitis encephalitis meningoencephalitis develops consequence LCMV hospitalization supportive treatment may required In circumstances antiinflammatory drugs may also considered In general mortality less one percent Lymphocytic choriomeningitis commonly reported infection humans though infections mild often never diagnosed Serological surveys suggest approximately – population US Europe antibodies LCMV The prevalence varies living conditions exposure mice higher past due lower standards living The island Vir Croatia one biggest described endemic places origin LCMV world IFA testing found LCMV antibodies population Individuals highest risk infection laboratory personnel handle rodents infected cells Temperature time year also critical factor contributes number LCMV infections particularly fall winter mice tend move indoors Approximately – cases immunocompetent individuals thought progress neurological disease mainly aseptic meningitis The overall case fatality rate less people complications including meningitis almost always recover completely Rare cases meningoencephalitis also reported More severe disease likely occur people immunosuppressed More infants congenital LCMV infection reported worldwide The probability woman become infected exposed rodents frequency LCMV crosses placenta likelihood clinical signs among infants still poorly understood In one study antibodies LCMV detected normal infants infants neurological signs infants hydrocephalus In Argentina congenital LCMV infections reported among healthy mothers infants However one study found two children home people severe mental disabilities infected virus The prognosis severely affected infants appears poor In one series infants diagnosed congenital infections died age months Transplantacquired lymphocytic choriomeningitis proves high morbidity mortality rate In three clusters reported US nine ten infected recipients died One donor infected recently acquired pet hamster sources virus cases unknown LCMV isolated fleas ticks cockroaches Culicoides Aedes mosquitoes Ticks lice mosquitoes shown transmit virus mechanically laboratory The presence LCMV laboratories may cause serious longterm repercussions worker safety In outbreak among humans occurred US cancer research institute studied effects various therapeutic diagnostic agents animal models Such agents developed animal care facility periodically screened sentinel animals extraneous infection Due oversight sentinel animals monitored August March When testing resumed LCMV antibodies found oldest sentinel hamsters Several workers reported symptoms consistent LCMV infection leading investigation Blood samples obtained tested LCMV antibodies Of workers tested seven definite serologic evidence past LCMV infection two hospitalized acute febrile illness All seven reported direct contact animals institute An additional hazard associated LCMV laboratories misleading experimental results Interference research may involve Reported outbreaks decreased perhaps due improved biohazard management laboratories However possible sporadic cases overlooked wide range clinical presentations Clare A Dykewicz et al recommend vigilant screening laboratory animals used research facilities either serum samples cell line aliquots well ensuring adequate ventilation housing areas use appropriate sanitation products Other practices reduce crosscontamination rodents include washing hands changing gloves animal care activities thoroughly decontaminating cages reusing avoiding housing healthy rodents vicinity potentially infected rodents Although house mouse Mus musculus primary reservoir host LCMV also often found wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus yellownecked mouse Apodemus flavicollis Hamster populations act reservoir hosts Other rodents including guinea pigs rats chinchillas infected appear maintain virus LCMV shown cause illness New World primates macaques marmosets tamarins Infections also reported rabbits dogs pigs After experimental inoculation incubation period adult mice days Congenitally neonatally infected mice hamsters become symptomatic several months longer A study conducted John Hotchin Heribert Weigand New York State Department Health concluded "The age mouse first exposed virus determines immune response" If LCMV infection occurs utero within first hours life immunologically unresponsive period mouse develop immune tolerance The virus continue proliferate indefinite time However mouse infected neonatal period immune system responsive immune response active This immunological conflict result one three ways immunological paralysis significant complete suppression virus immunity reinfection death Mice infected neonatal period often pass "runt" stage may last several weeks Clinical symptoms include excitability weight loss severe retardation growth hair development In general period time birth inoculation decreases less disease mortality occurs Post mortem lesions mice show signs hepatomegaly splenomegaly lymphadenopathy swollen shrunken pitted kidneys due glomerulonephritis Histological findings persistently infected mice often show chronic glomerulonephritis In mice hamsters vasculitis lymphocytic infiltrates many organs tissues including liver spleen lung kidneys pancreas blood vessels meninges brain present Pathogenesis occurs manner hamsters mice Symptoms hamsters highly variable typically indicate pet infected shedding virus several months Early signs may include inactivity loss appetite rough coat As disease progresses animal may experience weight loss hunched posture inflammation around eyes eventually death Alternatively infected hamsters may asymptomatic Experimental intracerebral infection suckling rats results microcephaly retinitis destruction several brain regions leading permanent abnormalities movement coordination vision behavior LCMV causes callitrichid hepatitis New World primates The onset infection nonspecific may include fever anorexia dyspnea weakness lethargy Jaundice characteristic petechial hemorrhages may develop Prostration death usually followNecropsy lesions primates callitrichid hepatitis show signs jaundice hepatomegaly splenomegaly subcutaneous intramuscular hemorrhages Pleural pericardial effusion sometimes sanguineous also reported On histology multifocal necrosis acidophilic bodies mild inflammatory infiltrates typically found liver As humans sensitivity testing methods rodents contributes accuracy diagnosis LCMV typically identified serology However endemically infected colony practical methods include MAP mouse antibody production PCR testing Another means
