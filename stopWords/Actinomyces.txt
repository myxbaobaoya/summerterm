See text. Actinomyces genus Actinomycetia class bacteria. They Grampositive. Actinomyces species facultatively anaerobic except A. meyeri A. israelii obligate anaerobes, grow best anaerobic conditions. Actinomyces species may form endospores, individual bacteria rodshaped, Actinomyces colonies form funguslike branched networks hyphae. The aspect colonies initially led incorrect assumption organism fungus name Actinomyces, "ray fungus" Greek actis, ray beam, mykes, fungus. Actinomyces species ubiquitous, occurring soil microbiota animals, including human microbiota. They known important role play soil ecology; produce number enzymes help degrade organic plant material, lignin, chitin. Thus, presence important formation compost. Certain species commensal skin flora, oral flora, gut flora, vaginal flora humans livestock. They also known causing diseases humans livestock, usually opportunistically gain access body's interior wounds. As opportunistic infections, people immunodeficiency higher risk. In preceding traits branching filament formation, bear similarities Nocardia. Like various anaerobes, Actinomyces species fastidious, thus easy culture isolate. Clinical laboratories culture isolate them, negative result rule infection, may due simply reluctance grow vitro. Phylogenetic trees based S ribosomal RNA SrRNA sequences shown genus Actinomyces quite diverse, exhibiting polyphyletic branching several clusters. The genera Actinomyces Mobiluncus form monophyletic clade phylogenetic tree constructed using RpoB, RpoC, DNA gyrase B protein sequences. This clade also strongly supported conserved signature indel consisting threeaminoacid insertion isoleucine tRNA synthetase found species genera Actinomyces Mobiluncus. Actinomycota normally present gums, common cause infection dental procedures oral abscesses. Many Actinomyces species opportunistic pathogens humans mammals, particularly oral cavity. In rare cases, bacteria cause actinomycosis, disease characterized formation abscesses mouth, lungs, gastrointestinal tract. Actinomycosis frequently caused A. israelii, may also cause endocarditis, though resulting symptoms may similar resulting infections bacterial species. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans identified note periodontal disease. The genus typically cause oralcervicofacial disease. It characterized painless "lumpy jaw". Lymphadenopathy uncommon form disease. Another form actinomycosis thoracic disease, often misdiagnosed neoplasm, forms mass extends chest wall. It arises aspiration organisms oropharynx. Symptoms include chest pain, fever, weight loss. Abdominal disease another manifestation actinomycosis. This lead sinus tract drains abdominal wall perianal area. Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, weight loss. Actinomyces species also shown infect central nervous system dog "without history evidence previous trauma organ involvement." Pelvic actinomycosis rare proven complication use intrauterine devices. In extreme cases, pelvic abscesses might develop. Treatment pelvic actinomycosis associated intrauterine devices involves removal device antibiotic treatment. Actinomycosis may considered patient chronic progression disease across tissue planes masslike times, sinus tract development may heal recur, refractory infection typical course antibiotics. Treatment actinomycosis consists antibiotics penicillin amoxicillin months, well surgery disease extensive. The genus Actinomyces comprises following species: Micrograph actinomycosis, HE stain Micrograph actinomycosis, GMS stain Micrograph actinomycosis, Gram stain
