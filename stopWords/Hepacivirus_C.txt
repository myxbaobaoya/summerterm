Hepatitis C virusHCVhuman hepatitis C virus The hepatitis C virus HCV small – nm size enveloped positivesense singlestranded RNA virus family Flaviviridae The hepatitis C virus cause hepatitis C cancers liver cancer hepatocellular carcinoma abbreviated HCC lymphomas humans The hepatitis C virus belongs genus Hepacivirus member family Flaviviridae Before considered member genus However member genus discovered dogs canine hepacivirus There also least one virus genus infects horses Several additional viruses genus described bats rodents The hepatitis C virus particle consists lipid membrane envelope nm diameter Two viral envelope glycoproteins E E embedded lipid envelope They take part viral attachment entry cell Within envelope icosahedral core nm diameter Inside core RNA material virus E E covalently bonded embedded envelope HCV stabilized disulfide bonds E globular seems protrude nm envelope membrane according electron microscope images These glycoproteins play important role interactions hepatitis C immune system A hypervariable region hypervariable region HVR found E glycoprotein HVR flexible quite accessible surrounding molecules HVR helps E shield virus immune system It prevents CD latching onto respective receptor virus In addition E shield E immune system Although HVR quite variable amino acid sequence region similar chemical physical conformational characteristics across many E glycoproteins Hepatitis C virus positive sense singlestranded RNA genome The genome consists single open reading frame nucleotide bases long This single open reading frame translated produce single protein product processed produce smaller active proteins This publicly available databases European Bioinformatics Institute viral proteome consists proteins At ′ ′ ends RNA untranslated regions UTR translated proteins important translation replication viral RNA The ′ UTR ribosome binding site internal ribosome entry site IRES initiates translation long protein containing amino acids The core domain HCV IRES contains fourway helical Holliday junction integrated within predicted pseudoknot The conformation core domain constrains open reading frames orientation positioning S ribosomal subunit The large preprotein later cleaved cellular viral proteases smaller proteins allow viral replication within host cell assemble mature viral particles Structural proteins made hepatitis C virus include Core protein E E nonstructural proteins include NS NS NSA NSB NSA NSBcitation needed The proteins virus arranged along genome following order N terminalcoreenvelope E–E–pnonstructural protein NS–NS–NSA–NSB–NSA–NSB–C terminal The mature nonstructural proteins NS NSB generation relies activity viral proteinases The NSNS junction cleaved metaldependent autocatalytic proteinase encoded within NS Nterminus NS The remaining cleavages downstream site catalysed serine protease also contained within Nterminal region NS An th protein also described This protein encoded frameshift capsid gene It appears antigenic function unknown Replication HCV involves several steps The virus replicates mainly hepatocytes liver estimated daily infected cell produces approximately fifty virions virus particles calculated total one trillion virions generated The virus may also replicate peripheral blood mononuclear cells potentially accounting high levels immunological disorders found chronically infected HCV patients In liver HCV particles brought hepatic sinusoids blood flow These sinusoids neighbor hepatocyte cells HCV able pass endothelium sinusoids make way basolateral surface hepatocyte cells HCV wide variety genotypes mutates rapidly due high error rate part virus RNAdependent RNA polymerase The mutation rate produces many variants virus considered quasispecies rather conventional virus species Entry host cells occur complex interactions virions especially glycoproteins cellsurface molecules CD LDL receptor SRBI DCSIGN Claudin Occludin The envelope HCV similar lowdensity lipoproteins VLDL lowdensity lipoproteins LDL Because similarity virus thought able associate apolipoproteins It could surround lipoproteins partially covering E E Recent research indicates apolipoproteins interact scavenger receptor B SRB SRB able remove lipids lipoproteins around virus better allow HVR contact Claudin tightjunction protein CD link create complex priming later HCV infection processes As immune system triggered macrophages increase amount TNFα around hepatocytes infected This triggers migration occludin another tightjunction complex basolateral membrane The HCV particle ready enter cell These interactions lead endocytosis viral particle This process aided clathrin proteins Once inside early endosome endosome viral envelope fuse RNA allowed cytoplasm HCV takes portions intracellular machinery replicate The HCV genome translated produce single protein around amino acids The polyprotein proteolytically processed viral cellular proteases produce three structural virionassociated seven nonstructural NS proteins Alternatively frameshift may occur Core region produce alternate reading frame protein ARFP HCV encodes two proteases NS cysteine autoprotease NSA serine protease The NS proteins recruit viral genome RNA replication complex associated rearranged cytoplasmic membranes RNA replication takes place via viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase NSB produces negative strand RNA intermediate The negative strand RNA serves template production new positive strand viral genomes Nascent genomes translated replicated packaged within new virus particles The virus replicates intracellular lipid membranes The endoplasmic reticulum particular deformed uniquely shaped membrane structures termed membranous webs These structures induced sole expression viral protein NSB The core protein associates lipid droplets utilises microtubules dyneins alter location perinuclear distribution Release hepatocyte may involve VLDL secretory pathway Another hypothesis states viral particle may secreted endoplasmic reticulum endosomal sorting complex required transport ESCRT pathway This pathway normally utilized bud vesicles cell The limitation hypothesis pathway normally used cellular budding known HCV would commandeer ESCRT pathway use endoplasmic reticulum Based genetic differences HCV isolates hepatitis C virus species classified six genotypes – several subtypes within genotype represented lowercase letters Subtypes broken quasispecies based genetic diversity Genotypes differ – nucleotide sites complete genome The difference genomic composition subtypes genotype usually – Subtypes b found worldwide cause cases Genotype clinically important determining potential response interferonbased therapy required duration therapy Genotypes less responsive interferonbased treatment genotypes The duration standard interferonbased therapy genotypes weeks whereas treatment genotypes completed weeks Sustained virological responses occur genotype cases genotypes genotype genotype In addition people African descent much less likely respond treatment infected genotypes The substantial proportion lack response treatment proposed caused singlenucleotide polymorphism SNP chromosome human genome predictive treatment success HCV genotypes distributed endemically overlapping areas West Central Africa infecting centuries human populations carrying genetic polymorphism question This prompted scientists suggest protracted persistence HCV genotypes people African origin evolutionary adaptation HCV many centuries populations immunogenetic responses Infection one genotype confer immunity others concurrent infection two strains possible In cases one strains outcompetes short time This finding may useful treatment replacing strains nonresponsive medication others easier treat When two viruses infect cell genetic recombination may occur Although infrequent HCV recombination observed different genotypes subtypes genotype even strains subtype Hepatitis C virus predominantly bloodborne virus low risk sexual vertical transmission Because mode spread key groups risk intravenous drug users IDUs recipients blood products sometimes patients haemodialysis Common setting transmission HCV also intrahospital nosocomial transmission practices
