Fusobacterium nucleatum oral bacterium, commensal human oral cavity, plays role periodontal disease. This organism commonly recovered different monocultured microbial mixed infections humans animals. It key component periodontal plaque due abundance ability coaggregate bacteria species oral cavity. Research implicates periodontal disease caused F. nucleatum preterm births humans. In many studies, F. nucleatum cells isolated amniotic fluid, placenta, chorioamnionic membranes women delivering prematurely. Moreover, laboratory mice inoculated directly blood F. nucleatum found deliver prematurely, pathology infection seems mirror observations humans. Together, research provides evidence possible causal connection F. nucleatumcaused periodontal disease least cases preterm delivery. F. nucleatum also isolated vaginal microbiome, especially women condition known bacterial vaginosis. Both F. nucleatum vaginal colonization bacterial vaginosis also linked preterm birth infections within uterus. Thus, preterm birth arising infections caused F. nucleatum could also arise invasive infection uterine tissue originating colonized vagina.citation needed F. nucleatum demonstrated association colon cancer. Fusobacterium species found higher quantities certain types colon tumors surrounding colon tissue colons healthy individuals, whether indirect correlation causal link unclear. A distinguishing mechanism described F. nucleatum creates proinflammatory environment conducive tumor growth recruitment tumorinfiltrating immune cells, which, unlike bacteria linked colorectal carcinoma, exacerbate pathological processes colitis, enteritis inflammatoryassociated intestinal carcinogenesis. This suggests direct specific carcinogenesis.
