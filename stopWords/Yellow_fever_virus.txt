Yellow fever viral disease typically short duration In cases symptoms include fever chills loss appetite nausea muscle pains – particularly back – headaches Symptoms typically improve within five days In people within day improving fever comes back abdominal pain occurs liver damage begins causing yellow skin If occurs risk bleeding kidney problems increased The disease caused yellow fever virus spread bite infected mosquito It infects humans primates several types mosquitoes In cities spread primarily Aedes aegypti type mosquito found throughout tropics subtropics The virus RNA virus genus Flavivirus The disease may difficult tell apart illnesses especially early stages To confirm suspected case bloodsample testing polymerase chain reaction required A safe effective vaccine yellow fever exists countries require vaccinations travelers Other efforts prevent infection include reducing population transmitting mosquitoes In areas yellow fever common early diagnosis cases immunization large parts population important prevent outbreaks Once person infected management symptomatic specific measures effective virus Death occurs half get severe disease In yellow fever resulted severe infections deaths worldwide nearly percent occurring Africa Nearly billion people live area world disease common It common tropical areas continents South America Africa Asia Since number cases yellow fever increasing This believed due fewer people immune people living cities people moving frequently changing climate increasing habitat mosquitoes The disease originated Africa spread Americas starting th century European trafficking enslaved Africans subSaharan Africa Since th century several major outbreaks disease occurred Americas Africa Europe In th th centuries yellow fever considered one dangerous infectious diseases numerous epidemics swept major cities US parts world In yellow fever virus first human virus isolated Yellow fever begins incubation period three six days Most cases cause mild infection fever headache chills back pain fatigue loss appetite muscle pain nausea vomiting In cases infection lasts three six days But cases people enter second toxic phase disease characterized recurring fever time accompanied jaundice due liver damage well abdominal pain Bleeding mouth nose eyes gastrointestinal tract cause vomit containing blood hence Spanish name yellow fever vómito negro "black vomit" There may also kidney failure hiccups delirium Among develop jaundice fatality rate overall fatality rate Severe cases may mortality greater Surviving infection provides lifelong immunity normally results permanent organ damage Yellow fever caused yellow fever virus enveloped RNA virus – nm width type species namesake family Flaviviridae It first illness

aegypti transmission female mosquito eggs larvae indicated This infection vectors without previous blood meal seems play role single sudden breakouts disease Three epidemiologically different infectious cycles occur virus transmitted mosquitoes humans primates In "urban cycle" yellow fever mosquito A aegypti involved It well adapted urban areas also transmit diseases including Zika fever dengue fever chikungunya The urban cycle responsible major outbreaks yellow fever occur Africa Except outbreak Bolivia urban cycle longer exists South America Besides urban cycle Africa South America sylvatic cycle forest jungle cycle present Aedes africanus Africa mosquitoes genus Haemagogus Sabethes South America serve vectors In jungle mosquitoes infect mainly nonhuman primates disease mostly asymptomatic African primates In South America sylvatic cycle currently way humans become infected explains low incidence yellow fever cases continent People become infected jungle carry virus urban areas A aegypti acts vector Because sylvatic cycle yellow fever cannot eradicated except eradicating mosquitoes serve vectors In Africa third infectious cycle known "savannah cycle" intermediate cycle occurs jungle urban cycles Different mosquitoes genus Aedes involved In recent years common form transmission yellow fever Africa Concern exists yellow fever spreading southeast Asia vector A aegypti already occurs After transmission mosquito viruses replicate lymph nodes infect dendritic cells particular From reach liver infect hepatocytes probably indirectly via Kupffer cells leads eosinophilic degradation cells release cytokines Apoptotic masses known Councilman bodies appear cytoplasm hepatocytes Fatality may occur cytokine storm shock multiple organ failure follow Yellow fever frequently clinical diagnosis based symptomatology travel history Mild cases disease confirmed virologically Since mild cases yellow fever also contribute significantly regional outbreaks every suspected case yellow fever involving symptoms fever pain nausea vomiting – days leaving affected area treated seriously If yellow fever suspected virus cannot confirmed – days following illness A direct confirmation obtained reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction genome virus amplified Another direct approach isolation virus growth cell culture using blood plasma take – weeks Serologically enzymelinked immunosorbent assay acute phase disease using specific IgM yellow fever increase specific IgG titer compared earlier sample confirm yellow fever Together clinical symptoms detection IgM fourfold increase IgG titer considered sufficient indication yellow fever As tests crossreact flaviviruses dengue virus indirect methods cannot conclusively prove yellow fever infection Liver biopsy verify inflammation necrosis hepatocytes detect viral antigens Because bleeding tendency yellow fever patients biopsy advisable post mortem confirm cause death In differential diagnosis infections yellow fever must distinguished feverish illnesses malaria Other viral hemorrhagic fevers Ebola virus Lassa virus Marburg virus Junin virus must excluded cause Personal prevention yellow fever includes vaccination avoidance mosquito bites areas yellow fever endemic Institutional measures prevention yellow fever include vaccination programmes measures control mosquitoes Programmes distribution mosquito nets use homes produce reductions cases malaria yellow fever Use EPAregistered insect repellent recommended outdoors Exposure even short time enough potential mosquito bite Longsleeved clothing long pants socks useful prevention The application larvicides waterstorage containers help eliminate potential mosquito breeding sites EPAregistered insecticide spray decreases transmission yellow fever Vaccination recommended traveling affected areas nonnative people tend develop severe illness infected Protection begins th day vaccine administration people reported last least years The World Health Organization WHO states single dose vaccine sufficient confer lifelong immunity yellow fever disease The attenuated live vaccine stem D developed Max Theiler The WHO recommends routine vaccination people living affected areas th th month birth Up one four people experience fever aches local soreness redness site injection In rare cases less one vaccination cause yellow fever vaccineassociated viscerotropic disease fatal cases It probably due genetic morphology immune system Another possible side effect infection nervous system occurs one cases causing yellow fever vaccineassociated neurotropic disease lead meningoencephalitis fatal less cases The Yellow Fever Initiative launched WHO vaccinated million people countries West Africa No outbreaks reported The campaign supported GAVI alliance governmental organizations Europe Africa According WHO mass vaccination cannot eliminate yellow fever vast number infected mosquitoes urban areas target countries significantly reduce number people infected Demand yellow fever vaccine continued increase due growing number countries implementing yellow fever vaccination part routine immunization programmes Recent upsurges yellow fever outbreaks Angola Democratic Republic Congo Uganda recently Nigeria Brazil increased demand straining global vaccine supply Therefore vaccinate susceptible populations preventive mass immunization campaigns outbreaks fractional dosing vaccine considered dosesparing strategy maximize limited vaccine supplies Fractional dose yellow fever vaccination refers administration reduced volume vaccine dose reconstituted per manufacturer recommendations The first practical use fractional dose yellow fever vaccination response large yellow fever outbreak Democratic Republic Congo mid In March WHO launched vaccination campaign Brazil million doses emergency stockpile In March WHO recommended vaccination travellers certain parts Brazil In March Brazil shifted policy announced planned vaccinate million currently unvaccinated citizens April Some countries Asia considered potentially danger yellow fever epidemics mosquitoes capability transmit yellow fever well susceptible monkeys present The disease yet occur Asia To prevent introduction virus countries demand previous vaccination foreign visitors passed yellow fever areas Vaccination proved vaccination certificate valid days vaccination lasts years Although WHO May advised subsequent booster vaccinations unnecessary older years certificate may acceptable border posts affected countries A list countries require yellow fever vaccination published WHO If vaccination cannot given reason dispensation may possible In case exemption certificate issued WHOapproved vaccination center required Although countries yellow fever occurs endemically vaccination programmes many countries less population vaccinated Control yellow fever mosquito A aegypti major importance especially mosquito also transmit dengue fever chikungunya disease A aegypti breeds preferentially water example installations inhabitants areas precarious drinking water supplies domestic refuse especially tires cans plastic bottles These conditions common urban areas developing countries Two main strategies employed reduce A aegypti populations One approach kill developing larvae Measures taken reduce water accumulations larvae develop Larvicides used along larvaeeating fish copepods reduce number larvae For many years copepods genus Mesocyclops used Vietnam preventing dengue fever This eradicated mosquito vector several areas Similar efforts may prove effective yellow fever Pyriproxyfen recommended chemical larvicide mainly safe humans effective small doses The second strategy reduce populations adult yellow fever mosquito Lethal ovitraps reduce Aedes populations using lesser amounts pesticide targets pest directly Curtains lids water tanks sprayed insecticides application inside houses recommended WHO Insecticidetreated mosquito nets effective Anopheles mosquito carries malaria Yellow fever lead death develop severe disease Jaundice fatigue heart rhythm problems seizures internal bleeding may also appear complications yellow fever recovery time As Flavivirus infections cure known yellow fever Hospitalization advisable intensive care may necessary rapid deterioration cases Certain acute treatment methods lack efficacy passive immunization emergence symptoms probably without effect ribavirin antiviral drugs well treatment interferons ineffective yellow fever patients Symptomatic treatment includes rehydration pain relief drugs paracetamol acetaminophen Acetylsalicylic acid aspirin However aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs often avoided increased risk gastrointestinal bleeding due anticoagulant effects Yellow fever common tropical subtropical areas South America Africa Worldwide million people live endemic areas The WHO estimates cases yellow fever worldwide year About people infected yellow fever progress severe form illness half die cure yellow fever An estimated yellow fever infections occur African continent In large outbreak originated Angola spread neighboring countries contained massive vaccination campaign In March April imported cases Angola genotype unvaccinated Chinese nationals reported China first appearance disease Asia recorded history Phylogenetic analysis identified seven genotypes yellow fever viruses assumed differently adapted humans vector A aegypti Five genotypes Angola CentralEast Africa East Africa West Africa I West Africa II occur Africa West Africa genotype I found Nigeria surrounding region West Africa genotype I appears especially infectious often associated major outbreaks The three genotypes found outside Nigeria Angola occur areas outbreaks rare Two outbreaks Kenya – Sudan involved East African genotype remained undetected previous years In South America two genotypes identified South American genotypes I II Based phylogenetic analysis two genotypes appear originated West Africa first introduced Brazil The date introduction predecessor African genotype gave rise South American genotypes appears confidence interval The historical record shows outbreak yellow fever occurred Recife Brazil The disease seems disappeared next outbreak occurring It likely introduced trafficking slaves slave trade Africa Genotype I divided five subclades A E In late large outbreak began Minas Gerais state Brazil characterized sylvan jungle epizootic It began outbreak brown howler monkeys serve sentinel species yellow fever spread men working jungle No cases transmitted humans A aegypti mosquito sustain urban outbreaks spread rapidly In April sylvan outbreak continued moving toward

eradicated yellow fever Cuba later Panama allowing completion Panama Canal While Reed built research Finlay historian François Delaporte notes yellow fever research contentious issue Scientists including Finlay Reed became successful building work less prominent scientists without always giving credit due Reeds research essential fight yellow fever He also credited using first type medical consent form experiments Cuba attempt ensure participants knew taking risk part testing Like Cuba Panama Brazil also led highly successful sanitation campaign mosquitoes yellow fever Beginning campaign led Oswaldo Cruz director general public health resulted eradicating disease also reshaping physical landscape Brazilian cities Rio de Janeiro During rainy seasons Rio de Janeiro regularly suffered floods water bay surrounding city overflowed Rios narrow streets Coupled poor drainage systems found throughout Rio created swampy conditions citys neighborhoods Pools stagnant water stood yearlong city streets proved fertile ground diseasecarrying mosquitoes Thus Cruzs direction public health units known "mosquito inspectors" fiercely worked combat yellow fever throughout Rio spraying exterminating rats improving drainage destroying unsanitary housing Ultimately citys sanitation renovation campaigns reshaped Rio de Janeiros neighborhoods Its poor residents pushed city centers Rios suburbs towns found outskirts city In later years Rios impoverished inhabitants would come reside favelas During – Rockefeller Foundations International Health Board undertook expensive successful yellow fever eradication campaign Mexico The IHB gained respect Mexicos federal government success The eradication yellow fever strengthened relationship US Mexico good years prior The eradication yellow fever also major step toward better global health In scientists isolated yellow fever virus West Africa Following two vaccines developed Max Theiler led completion D yellow fever vaccine subsequently awarded Nobel Prize Physiology Medicine That vaccine D still use although newer vaccines based vero cells development Using vector control strict vaccination programs urban cycle yellow fever nearly eradicated South America Since single urban outbreak Santa Cruz de la Sierra Bolivia occurred Since however number yellow fever cases increasing A aegypti returned urban centers South America This partly due limitations available insecticides well habitat dislocations caused climate change It also vector control program abandoned Although new urban cycle yet established scientists believe could happen point An outbreak Paraguay thought urban nature ultimately proved case In Africa virus eradication programs mostly relied upon vaccination These programs largely unsuccessful
