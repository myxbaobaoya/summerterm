Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Gramnegative sulfatereducing bacteria. It generally found soils, waters, stools animals, although rare cases found cause infection humans. It particularly noted ability produce methyl mercury. Also 'reductive glycine pathway', seventh route organisms capture CO, discovered species. Since bacteria killed exposure atmospheric oxygen, environmental niches frequently occupied bacteria anaerobic. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans reported produce gene transfer agents Desulfovibrio desulfuricans described motile, rodshaped, Gramnegative obligate anaerobe polar flagella. It measures approximately μm .μm. D. desulfuricans genome NCBI
