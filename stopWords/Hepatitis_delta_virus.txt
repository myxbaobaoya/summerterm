Hepatitis D type viral hepatitis caused hepatitis delta virus HDV HDV one five known hepatitis viruses A B C D E HDV considered satellite type subviral agent propagate presence hepatitis B virus HBV Transmission HDV occur either via simultaneous infection HBV coinfection superimposed chronic hepatitis B hepatitis B carrier state superinfection HDV infecting person chronic hepatitis B superinfection considered serious type viral hepatitis due severity complications These complications include greater likelihood experiencing liver failure acute infections rapid progression liver cirrhosis increased risk developing liver cancer chronic infections In combination hepatitis B virus hepatitis D highest fatality rate hepatitis infections A recent estimate suggests currently million persons infected virus The hepatitis delta viruses HDV eight species negativesense singlestranded RNA viruses viruslike particles classified together genus Deltavirus within realm Ribozyviria The HDV virion small spherical enveloped particle nm diameter viral envelope contains host phospholipids well three proteins taken hepatitis B virusthe large medium small hepatitis B surface antigens This assembly surrounds inner ribonucleoprotein RNP particle contains genome surrounded molecules hepatitis D antigen HDAg genome The central region HDAg shown bind RNA Several interactions also mediated coiledcoil region N terminus HDAg The HDV genome negative sense singlestranded closed circular RNA genome approximately nucleotides HDV smallest "virus" known infect animals It proposed HDV may originated class plant pathogens called viroids much smaller viruses Its genome unique among animal viruses high GC nucleotide content Its nucleotide sequence selfcomplementary allowing genome form partially doublestranded rodlike RNA structure HDV strains highly divergent fusions different strains exist sequences deposited public databases employing different start sites circular viral DNA involved This resulted something chaos respect molecular classification virus situation resolved recently adoption proposed reference genome uniform classification system Like hepatitis B HDV gains entry liver cells via NTCP bile transporter HDV recognizes receptor via Nterminal domain large hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg Mapping mutagenesis domain shown amino acid residues – make receptorbinding site After entering hepatocyte virus uncoated nucleocapsid translocated nucleus due signal HDAg Since HDV genome code RNA polymerase replicate virus genome virus makes use host cellular RNA polymerases Initially thought use RNA polymerase II RNA polymerases I III also shown involved HDV replication Normally RNA polymerase II utilizes DNA template produces mRNA Consequently HDV indeed utilizes RNA polymerase II replication would known animal pathogen capable using DNAdependent polymerase RNAdependent polymerasecitation needed The RNA polymerases treat RNA genome doublestranded DNA due folded rodlike structure Three forms RNA made circular genomic RNA circular complementary antigenomic RNA linear polyadenylated antigenomic RNA mRNA containing open reading frame HDAg Synthesis antigenomic RNA occurs nucleolus mediated RNA polymerase I whereas synthesis genomic RNA takes place nucleoplasm mediated RNA polymerase II HDV RNA synthesized first linear RNA contains many copies genome The genomic antigenomic RNA contain sequence nucleotides hepatitis delta virus ribozyme acts ribozyme selfcleaves linear RNA monomers These monomers ligated form circular RNA A significant difference viroids HDV viroids produce proteins HDV known produce one protein namely HDAg It comes two forms kDa largeHDAg smallHDAg kDa The Nterminals two forms identical differ amino acids Cterminal large HDAg Both isoforms produced reading frame contains UAG stop codon codon normally produces smallHDAg However editing cellular enzyme adenosine deaminase changes stop codon UGG allowing largeHDAg produced Despite identical sequences two proteins play diverging roles course infection HDAgS produced early stages infection enters nucleus supports viral replication HDAgL contrast produced later stages infection acts inhibitor viral replication required assembly viral particles Thus RNA editing cellular enzymes critical virus life cycle regulates balance viral replication virion assemblycitation needed The HDV envelope protein three HBV surface proteins anchored The S region genome commonly expressed main function assemble subviral particles HDV antigen proteins combine viral genome form ribonucleoprotein RNP enveloped subviral particles form virallike particles almost identical mature HDV infectious Researchers concluded determinant infectivity HDV within Nterminal preS domain large protein L It found mediator binding cellular receptor Researchers Georges Abou Jaoudé Camille Sureau published article studied role antigenic loop found HDV envelope proteins infectivity virus The antigenic loop like Nterminal preS domain large protein exposed virion surface Jaoudé Sureaus study provided evidence antigenic loop may important factor HDV entry host cell mutating parts antigenic loop infectivity HDV may minimized The routes transmission hepatitis D similar hepatitis B Infection largely restricted persons high risk hepatitis B infection particularly injecting drug users persons receiving clotting factor concentrates Worldwide million people coinfected HDV rare developed countries mostly associated intravenous drug use However HDV much common immediate Mediterranean region subSaharan Africa Middle East northern part South America In million people may infected HDV The vaccine hepatitis B protects hepatitis D virus latters dependence presence hepatitis B virus replicate In absence specific vaccine delta virus vaccine HBV must given soon birth risk groupscitation needed Hepatitis D generally considered dominant virus hepatitis B except rare instances Current established treatments chronic hepatitis D include conventional pegylated interferon alpha therapy Latest evidence suggests pegylated interferon alpha effective reducing viral load effect disease time drug given benefit generally stops drug discontinued The efficiency treatment usually exceed late relapse therapy reported In May Committee Medicinal Products Human Use European Medicines Agency approved antiviral Hepcludex bulevirtide treat hepatitis D B Bulevirtide binds inactivates sodiumbile acid cotransporter blocking viruses entering hepatocytes Those afflicted individuals infected Hepatitis B virus Hepatitis D HDV virus needs HBsAg hepatitis B surface antigen packaging transmission The disease present worldwide Infection HDV major medical scourge low income regions globe HBV remains endemic It therefore prevalent countries HBV infection also common currently Amazon basin low income regions Asia Africa Improved measures control HBV industrialised countries vaccination also reduced prevalence HDV main remaining atrisk populations countries injection drug users immigrants endemic HDV areas Hepatitis D virus first reported nuclear antigen patients infected HBV severe liver disease This nuclear antigen thought hepatitis B antigen called delta antigen Subsequent experiments chimpanzees showed hepatitis delta

neurological symptoms agitation delirium convulsions hemorrhagic coma commonly appear These symptoms arise fulminant hepatitis may kill less week characteristically affects children young adults males females It accompanied also encephalitis many cases The disease highly lethal study carried Boca Acre also Amazon patients died acute phase disease Survivors may develop chronic diseasecitation needed The main discovery delta virus HBV association done Gilberta Bensabath Instituto Evandro Chagas Belém state Pará collaboratorscitation needed Infected patients show extensive destruction liver tissue
