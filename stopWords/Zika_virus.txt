Zika virus ZIKV pronounced ˈziːkə ˈzɪkə member virus family Flaviviridae It spread daytimeactive Aedes mosquitoes A aegypti A albopictus Its name comes Ziika Forest Uganda virus first isolated Zika virus shares genus dengue yellow fever Japanese encephalitis West Nile viruses Since known occur within narrow equatorial belt Africa Asia From update virus spread eastward across Pacific Ocean Americas leading – Zika virus epidemic The infection known Zika fever Zika virus disease often causes mild symptoms similar mild form dengue fever While specific treatment paracetamol acetaminophen rest may help symptoms As April vaccines approved clinical use however number vaccines currently clinical trials Zika spread pregnant woman baby This result microcephaly severe brain malformations birth defects Zika infections adults may result rarely Guillain–Barré syndrome In January United States Centers Disease Control Prevention CDC issued travel guidance affected countries including use enhanced precautions guidelines pregnant women including considering postponing travel Other governments health agencies also issued similar travel warnings Colombia Dominican Republic Puerto Rico Ecuador El Salvador Jamaica advised women postpone getting pregnant known risks Zika virus belongs family Flaviviridae genus Flavivirus thus related dengue yellow fever Japanese encephalitis West Nile viruses Like flaviviruses Zika virus enveloped icosahedral nonsegmented singlestranded kilobase positivesense RNA genome It closely related Spondweni virus one two known viruses Spondweni virus clade A positivesense RNA genome directly translated viral proteins As flaviviruses similarly sized West Nile virus RNA genome encodes seven nonstructural proteins three structural proteins form single polyprotein QZE One structural proteins encapsulates virus This protein flavivirus envelope glycoprotein binds endosomal membrane host cell initiate endocytosis The RNA genome forms nucleocapsid along copies kDa capsid protein The nucleocapsid turn enveloped within hostderived membrane modified two viral glycoproteins Viral genome replication depends making doublestranded RNA singlestranded positivesense RNA ssRNA genome followed transcription replication provide viral mRNAs new ssRNA genomes A longitudinal study shows hours cells infected Zika virus vacuoles mitochondria cells begin swell This swelling becomes severe results cell death also known paraptosis This form programmed cell death requires gene expression IFITM transmembrane protein cell able protect viral infection blocking virus attachment Cells susceptible Zika infection levels IFITM low Once cell infected virus restructures endoplasmic reticulum forming large vacuoles resulting cell death There two Zika lineages African lineage Asian lineage Phylogenetic studies indicate virus spreading Americas identical African genotypes closely related Asian strain circulated French Polynesia – outbreak The Asian strain appears first evolved around The vertebrate hosts virus primarily monkeys socalled enzootic mosquitomonkeymosquito cycle occasional transmission humans Before current pandemic began Zika "rarely caused recognized spillover infections humans even highly enzootic areas" Infrequently however arboviruses become established human disease spread mosquito–human–mosquito cycle like yellow fever virus dengue fever virus flaviviruses chikungunya virus togavirus Though reason pandemic unknown dengue related arbovirus infects species mosquito vectors known particular intensified urbanization globalization Zika primarily spread Aedes aegypti mosquitoes also transmitted sexual contact blood transfusions The basic reproduction number R measure transmissibility Zika virus estimated In news reports drew attention rapid spread Zika Latin America Caribbean At time Pan American Health Organization published list countries territories experienced "local Zika virus transmission" comprising Barbados Bolivia Brazil Colombia Dominican Republic Ecuador El Salvador French Guiana Guadeloupe Guatemala Guyana Haiti Honduras Martinique Mexico Panama Paraguay Puerto Rico Saint Martin Suriname Venezuela By August countries experienced active local transmission Zika virus Zika primarily spread female Aedes aegypti mosquito active mostly daytime The mosquitos must feed blood lay eggs The virus also isolated number arboreal mosquito species genus Aedes A africanus A apicoargenteus A furcifer A hensilli A luteocephalus A vittatus extrinsic incubation period mosquitoes around days The true extent vectors still unknown Zika detected many species Aedes along Anopheles coustani Mansonia uniformis Culex perfuscus although alone incriminate vectors To detect presence virus usually requires genetic material analysed lab using technique RTPCR A much cheaper faster method involves shining light head thorax mosquito detecting chemical compounds characteristic virus using nearinfrared spectroscopy Transmission A albopictus tiger mosquito reported urban outbreak Gabon newly invaded country become primary vector concomitant chikungunya dengue virus outbreaks New outbreaks occur person carrying virus travels another region A albopictus common The potential societal risk Zika delimited distribution mosquito species transmit The global distribution cited carrier Zika A aegypti expanding due global trade travel A aegypti distribution extensive ever recorded – parts continents except Antarctica including North America even European periphery Madeira Netherlands northeastern Black Sea coast A mosquito population capable carrying Zika found Capitol Hill neighborhood Washington DC genetic evidence suggests survived least four consecutive winters region The study authors conclude mosquitos adapting persistence northern climate Zika virus appears contagious via mosquitoes around week infection The virus thought infectious longer period time infection least weeks transmitted via semen Research ecological niche suggests Zika may influenced greater degree changes precipitation temperature dengue making likely confined tropical areas However rising global temperatures would allow disease vector expand range north allowing Zika follow Zika transmitted men women sexual partners known cases involve transmission symptomatic men women As April sexual transmission Zika documented six countries – Argentina Australia France Italy New Zealand United States – outbreak ZIKV persist semen several months viral RNA detected one year The virus replicates human testis infects several cell types including testicular macrophages peritubular cells germ cells spermatozoa precursors Semen parameters altered patients several weeks postsymptoms onset spermatozoa infectious Since October CDC advised men traveled area Zika use condoms sex least six months return virus still transmissible even symptoms never develop Zika virus spread vertical "mothertochild" transmission pregnancy delivery An infection pregnancy linked changes neuronal development unborn child Severe progressions infection linked development microcephaly unborn child mild infections potentially lead neurocognitive disorders later life Congenital brain abnormalities microcephaly also reported Zika outbreak Studies mice suggested maternal immunity dengue virus may enhance fetal infection Zika worsen microcephaly phenotype andor enhance damage pregnancy unknown whether occurs humans As April update two cases Zika transmission blood transfusions reported globally Brazil US Food Drug Administration FDA recommended screening blood donors deferring highrisk donors weeks A potential risk suspected based blooddonor screening study French Polynesian Zika outbreak donors November February tested positive Zika RNA asymptomatic time blood donation Eleven positive donors reported symptoms Zika fever donation three samples grew culture Zika virus replicates mosquitos midgut epithelial cells salivary gland cells After – days virus found mosquitos saliva If mosquitos saliva inoculated human skin virus infect epidermal keratinocytes skin fibroblasts skin Langerhans cells The pathogenesis virus hypothesized continue spread lymph nodes bloodstream Flaviviruses replicate cytoplasm Zika antigens found infected cell nuclei The viral protein numbered NSA lead small head size microcephaly disrupts brain growth hijacking pathway regulates growth new neurons In fruit flies NSA neighboring NSB restrict eye growth Zika fever also known Zika virus disease illness caused Zika virus Most cases symptoms present usually mild resemble dengue fever Symptoms may include fever red eyes joint pain headache maculopapular rash Symptoms generally last less seven days It caused reported deaths initial infection Infection pregnancy causes microcephaly brain malformations babies Infection adults linked Guillain–Barré syndrome GBS Zika virus shown infect human Schwann cells Diagnosis testing blood urine saliva presence Zika virus RNA person sick In improved diagnostic test based research Washington University St Louis detects Zika infection serum granted market authorization FDA Prevention involves decreasing mosquito bites areas disease occurs proper use condoms Efforts prevent bites include use DEET picaridin based insect repellent covering much body clothing mosquito nets getting rid standing water mosquitoes reproduce There vaccine Health officials recommended women areas affected – Zika outbreak consider putting pregnancy pregnant women travel areas While specific treatment exists paracetamol acetaminophen rest may help symptoms Admission hospital rarely necessary The World Health Organization suggested priority develop inactivated vaccines nonlive vaccines safe use pregnant women As March update companies institutions developing vaccines Zika state vaccine unlikely widely available years In June FDA granted first approval human clinical trial Zika vaccine In March DNA vaccine approved phase clinical trials This vaccine consists small circular piece DNA known plasmid expresses genes Zika virus envelope proteins As vaccine contain full sequence virus cannot cause infection As April subunit inactivated vaccines entered clinical trials The virus first isolated April rhesus macaque monkey placed cage Ziika Forest Uganda near Lake Victoria scientists Yellow Fever Research Institute A second isolation mosquito A africanus followed site January When monkey developed fever researchers isolated serum "filterable transmissible agent" named Zika Zika first known infect humans results serological survey Uganda published Of human blood samples tested neutralizing antibodies As part outbreak investigation jaundice suspected yellow fever researchers reported isolation virus patient pathogen later shown closely related Spondweni virus Spondweni also determined cause selfinflicted infection researcher reported Subsequent serological studies several African Asian countries indicated virus widespread within human populations regions The first true case human infection identified Simpson infected isolating virus mosquitoes From confirmed human cases Zika infection Africa Southeast Asia A study published showed Zika virus despite cases reported silently circulated West Africa last two decades blood samples collected tested ZIKV IgM antibodies In April first outbreak outside Africa Asia occurred island Yap Federated States Micronesia characterized rash conjunctivitis arthralgia initially thought dengue chikungunya Ross River disease Serum samples patients acute phase illness contained RNA Zika There confirmed cases unconfirmed cases hospitalizations deaths After October Oceanias first outbreak showed estimated population infected French Polynesia also presented Guillain–Barre syndrome GBS The spread ZIKV continued New Caledonia Easter Island Cook Islands cases confirmed January During year Easter Island acknowledged cases Australia began seeing cases Research showed brought travelers returning Indonesia infected countries New Zealand also experienced infections rate increases returning foreign travelers Oceania countries experiencing Zika today New Caledonia Vanuatu Solomon Islands Marshall Islands American Samoa Samoa Tonga Between epidemics occurred French Polynesia Easter Island Cook Islands New Caledonia There epidemic Americas The outbreak began April Brazil spread countries South America Central America North America Caribbean In January WHO said virus likely spread throughout Americas end year February WHO declared cluster microcephaly Guillain–Barré syndrome cases reported Brazil – strongly suspected associated Zika outbreak – Public Health Emergency International Concern It estimated million people infected Zika Brazil cases microcephaly reported October January A number countries issued travel warnings outbreak expected significantly impact tourism industry Several countries taken unusual step advising citizens delay pregnancy known virus impact fetal development With Summer Olympics hosted Rio de Janeiro health officials worldwide voiced concerns potential crisis Brazil international athletes tourists returned home possibly would spread virus Some researchers speculated one two tourists might infected threeweek period approximately infections per tourists In November World Health Organization declared Zika virus longer global emergency noting virus still represents "a highly significant longterm problem" As August number new Zika virus cases Americas fallen dramatically On May three cases Zika virus infection India reported state Gujarat By late least cases Rajasthan Madhya Pradesh In July first case Zika virus infection Indian state Kerala reported After first confirmed case people previously presented symptoms tested positive results showing Zika circulating Kerala since least May By August th reported cases Kerala In October officer Indian Air Force Kanpur tested positive Zika virus making first reported case Indian state Uttar Pradesh On March Reuters reported Zika isolated blood sample elderly man Chittagong Bangladesh part retrospective study Zika also occurring Tanzania Between August November cases Zika virus infection confirmed Singapore In Angola reported two cases Zika fever This
