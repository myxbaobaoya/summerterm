Actinomyces viscosus human animal pathogenpathobiont colonises mouths adult humans. A. viscosus low level virulence often mistaken actinomycetes. A. viscosus Grampositive, facultatively anaerobic, rodshaped, filamentous. It grows slowly nonselective media, forming gray white colonies. A. viscosus causes periodontal disease animals isolated human dental calculus root surface caries, well oral cavity hamsters actinomycotic lesions swine, cats, dogs. Furthermore, shown cause endocarditis humans. A. viscosus also known cause lung infections, cases. Infections treatable penicillin threeweek therapies. A. viscosus infection symptoms indistinguishable Actinomyces israelii infection symptoms Actinomyces bovis infection symptoms. A. israelii A. bovis infections usually cause actinomycotic infections, sometimes rarely pathogen A. viscosus. A. viscosus colonies test positive catalase negative indole. Multipleweek antibiotic therapies cured actinomycotic infections caused A. viscosus every recorded case. Therapies include treatment penicillin, sulfadimethoxine, flucloxacillin, clindamycin, tetracycline, ticarcillin. A. viscosus usually resistant vancomycin, metronidazole, cefalexin, dicloxacillin. Treatments last least three weeks, exceptions. Although A. viscosus difficult distinguish closely related actinomycetes, general determination actinomycete sufficient treatment infections.
