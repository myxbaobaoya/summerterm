Kaposis sarcomaassociated herpesvirus KSHV ninth known human herpesvirus formal name according International Committee Taxonomy Viruses ICTV Human gammaherpesvirus HHV short Like herpesviruses informal names used interchangeably formal ICTV name This virus causes Kaposis sarcoma cancer commonly occurring AIDS patients well primary effusion lymphoma HHVassociated multicentric Castlemans disease KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome It one seven currently known human cancer viruses oncoviruses Even many years discovery KSHVHHV known cure KSHV associated tumorigenesis In Moritz Kaposi described blood vessel tumor originally called "idiopathic multiple pigmented sarcoma skin" since eponymously named Kaposis sarcoma KS KS first thought uncommon tumor Jewish Mediterranean populations later determined extremely common throughout subSaharan African populations This led first suggestions tumor might caused virus With onset AIDS epidemic early sudden resurgence KS affecting AIDS patients reported AIDS patients tumoran extraordinary rate cancer predispositioncitation needed Careful analysis epidemiologic data Valerie Beral Thomas Peterman Harold Jaffe led investigators propose KS caused unknown sexually transmitted virus rarely causes tumors unless host becomes immunosuppressed AIDScitation needed As early scientists reported seeing herpesviruslike structures KS tumors examined electron microscopy Scientists searching agent causing KS agents proposed possible cause including cytomegalovirus HIV The pathogen ultimately identified Yuan Chang Patrick S Moore wife

host replication machinery LANA tethers viral DNA cellular chromosomes inhibits p retinoblastoma protein suppresses viral genes needed full virus production assembly "lytic replication" Why subset virus genes expressed latency fully understood But shown latency associated gene expression explained part characteristic epigenetic state KSHV episome acquires latency LANA plays important role latency regulating host virus transcripts binding multiple active promoters also associates host protein hSET creates HKme marks chromatin Various signals inflammation may provoke virus enter lytic replication The primary viral protein responsible switch latent lytic replication known ORF Replication Transactivation Activator RTA When cell signaling conditions activate generation RTA turn activates synthesis stereotypic cascade secondary tertiary viral proteins ultimately make components virus capsid also DNA synthesis enzymes required replicate virus genome During lytic replication believed virus genome replicated continuous linear molecule episome socalled rolling circle model As unit genome replicated cut within terminal repeat region packaged virus particle virion The virus becomes enveloped lipid membrane transits nucleus cytoplasm exit cell Thus whereas KSHV genome circular nucleus latently infected cells packaged infectious viruses linear molecule When virus enters lytic replication thousands virus particles made single cell usually results death infected cellcitation needed It discovered infection SARSCoV virus virus causes COVID may induce lytic reactivation KSHV human body causing herpes virus cease latency begin formation cancerous cells Further discovered medications used treat infection SARSCoV namely Nafamostat Azithromycin ended promoting production mature virions " potentially inducing KSHV lytic reactivation" The mechanisms virus contracted well understood Healthy individuals infected virus show signs symptoms due immune systems ability keep infection check Infection particular concern immunocompromised Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy AIDS patients organ transplant patients high risk showing signs infectioncitation needed Recent advances sequencing technologies uncovered virus chromatinized latency It also shown virus encoded microRNA manipulates interacts host mRNA also deregulate host long noncoding RNA lncRNA More recently circularRNAs circRNAs recently discovered EBV KSHV Infection virus thought lifelong healthy immune system keep virus check Many people infected KSHV never show symptoms Kaposis sarcoma occurs someone infected KSHV becomes immunocompromised due AIDS medical treatment rarely aging KSHV known causative agent four diseases In global prevalence rate HHV The seroprevalence HHV varies significantly geographically infection rates northern European southeast Asian Caribbean countries Mediterranean countries approximately subSaharan African countries approximately In South America infection rates low general high among Amerindians Even within individual countries significant variation observed across different regions infection rates Xinjiang compared Hubei China Although seroprevalence
