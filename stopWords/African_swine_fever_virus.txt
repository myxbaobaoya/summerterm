African swine fever virus ASFV large doublestranded DNA virus Asfarviridae family It causative agent African swine fever ASF The virus causes hemorrhagic fever high mortality rates domestic pigs isolates cause death animals quickly week infection It persistently infects natural hosts warthogs bushpigs soft ticks genus Ornithodoros likely act vector disease signs It cause disease humans ASFV endemic subSaharan Africa exists wild cycle infection ticks wild pigs bushpigs warthogs The disease first described European settlers brought pigs areas endemic ASFV example emerging infectious disease ASFV replicates cytoplasm infected cells It virus doublestranded DNA genome known transmitted arthropods ASFV large – nm icosahedral doublestranded DNA virus linear genome kilobases containing genes The number genes differs slightly among different isolates virus ASFV similarities large DNA viruses eg poxvirus iridovirus mimivirus In common viral hemorrhagic fevers main target cells replication monocyte macrophage lineage Entry virus host cell receptormediated precise mechanism endocytosis presently unclear The virus encodes enzymes required replication transcription genome including elements base excision repair system structural proteins many proteins essential replication cells instead roles virus survival transmission hosts Virus replication takes place perinuclear factory areas It highly orchestrated process least four stages transcriptionimmediateearly early intermediate late The majority replication assembly occurs discrete perinuclear regions cell called virus factories finally progeny virions transported plasma membrane along microtubules bud propelled away along actin projections infect new cells As virus progresses lifecycle host cells organelles modified adapted cases destroyed Assembly icosahedral capsid occurs modified membranes endoplasmic reticulum Products proteolytically processed polyproteins form core shell internal membrane nucleoprotein core An additional outer membrane gained particles bud plasma membrane The virus encodes proteins inhibit signalling pathways infected macrophages thus modulate transcriptional activation immune response genes In addition virus encodes proteins inhibit apoptosis infected cells facilitate production progeny virions Viral membrane proteins similarity cellular adhesion proteins modulate interaction virusinfected cells extracellular virions host components Based sequence variation Cterminal region BL gene encoding major capsid protein p ASFV genotypes I–XXIII identified All ASFV p genotypes circulating eastern southern Africa Genotype I circulating Europe South America Caribbean western Africa Genotype VIII confined four East African countries The virus thought derived virus soft tick genus Ornithodoros infects wild swine including giant forest hogs Hylochoerus meinertzhageni warthogs Phacochoerus africanus bushpigs Potamochoerus porcus In wild hosts infection generally asymptomatic This virus appears evolved around AD This date corroborated historical record Pigs initially domesticated North Africa Eurasia They introduced southern Africa Europe Far East Portuguese years ago Chinese years ago respectively At end th century extensive pig industry native region ASFV Kenya started massive losses cattle due rinderpest outbreak Pigs imported massive scale breeding colonizers Seychelles England Pig farming freerange time The first outbreak ASF reported ASFV known close relatives It species genus Asfivirus family Asfarviridae order Asfuvirales Each three taxa least partly named ASFV In acute form disease caused highly virulent strains pigs may develop high fever show noticeable symptoms first days They gradually lose appetites become depressed In whiteskinned pigs extremities turn blueishpurple hemorrhages become apparent ears abdomen Groups infected pigs lie huddled together shivering breathing abnormally sometimes coughing If forced stand appear unsteady legs called congenital tremor type AI newborn piglets Within days infection enter comatose state die In pregnant sows spontaneous abortions occur In milder infections affected pigs lose weight become thin develop signs pneumonia skin ulcers swollen joints The clinical symptoms ASFV infection similar classical swine fever two diseases normally distinguished laboratory diagnosis This diagnosis usually performed ELISA real time PCR isolation virus either blood lymph nodes spleen serum infected pig The virus spread ticks also swine eating pork products contain virus The National Pig Association UK industry body states virus also transmitted direct indirect contact infected pigs faeces body fluids As virus may survive days pig faeces months years pork products association advises strict biosecurity measures pig farms including threeday quarantine entering UK avoiding pigs areas wild boar found Vietnam successfully produced first vaccine African swine fever
