Of species colonize humans, two pathogens, N. meningitidis N. gonorrhoeae. Most gonococcal infections asymptomatic selfresolving, epidemic strains meningococcus may carried population systemic disease occurs prevalence. Neisseria species Gramnegative bacteria included among Pseudomonadota, large group Gramnegative forms. Neisseria diplococci resemble coffee beans viewed microscopically. Species genus family Neisseriaceae parasitic bacteria grow pairs occasionally tetrads, thrive best . °F °C animal body serum media. The genus includes: These two species ability 'breaching' barrier. Local cytokines area become secreted initiate immune response. However, neutrophils able job due ability Neisseria invade replicate within neutrophils, well avoiding phagocytosis killed complement resisting opsonization antibodies, target pathogen destruction. Neisseria species also able alter antigens avoid engulfed process called antigenic variation, observed primarily surfacelocated molecules. The pathogenic species along commensal species, type IV pili serve multiple functions organism. Some functions type IV pili include: mediating attachment various cells tissues, twitching motility, natural competence, microcolony formation, extensive intrastrain phase, antigenic variation. Neisseria bacteria also shown important factor early stages canine plaque development. This genus also contains several, believed commensal, nonpathogenic, species: However, associated disease. All medically significant species Neisseria positive catalase oxidase. Different Neisseria species identified sets sugars produce acid. For example, N. gonorrhoeae makes acid glucose, N. meningitidis produces acid glucose maltose. Polysaccharide capsule. N. meningitidis polysaccharide capsule surrounds outer membrane bacterium protects soluble immune effector mechanisms within serum. It considered essential virulence factor bacteria. N. gonorrhoeae possesses capsule. Unlike Gramnegative bacteria, possess lipopolysaccharide LPS, pathogenic commensal species Neisseria lipooligosaccharide LOS consists core polysaccharide lipid A. It functions endotoxin, protects antimicrobial peptides, adheres asialoglycoprotein receptor urethral epithelium. LOS highly stimulatory human immune system. LOS sialylation enzyme Lst prevents phagocytosis neutrophils complement deposition. LOS modification phosphoethanolamine enzyme LptA provides resistance antimicrobial peptides complement. Strains species ability produce different LOS glycoforms. The genus Neisseria named German bacteriologist Albert Neisser, discovered first example, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, pathogen causes human disease gonorrhea. Neisser also codiscovered pathogen causes leprosy, Mycobacterium leprae. These discoveries made possible development new staining techniques helped develop. The genomes least Neisseria species completely sequenced. The beststudied species N. meningitidis strains N. gonorrhoeae least strains completely sequenced. Other complete genomes available N. elongata, N. lactamica, N. weaveri. Whole genome shotgun sequences available hundreds species strains. N. meningitidis encodes , , proteins N. gonorrhoeae encodes , , proteins. N. weaveri strain NCTC smallest known genome , encoded proteins although N. meningitidis MC reported genes. The genomes generally quite similar. For example, genome N. gonorrhoeae strain FA compared N. meningitidis strain H genes shared. Diseases caused N. meningitidis N. gonorrhoeae significant health problems worldwide, control largely dependent availability widespread use comprehensive meningococcal gonococcal vaccines. Development neisserial vaccines challenging due nature organisms, particular heterogeneity, variability andor poor immunogenicity outer surface components. As strictly human pathogens, highly adapted host environment, evolved several mechanisms remain adaptable changing microenvironments avoid elimination host immune system. Currently, serogroup A, B, C, Y, W meningococcal infections prevented vaccines. However, prospect developing gonococcal vaccine remote. The acquisition cephalosporin resistance N. gonorrhoeae, particularly ceftriaxone resistance, greatly complicated treatment gonorrhea, gonococcus classified "superbug". Genetic transformation process recipient bacterial cell takes DNA neighboring cell integrates DNA recipients genome recombination. In N. meningitidis N. gonorrhoeae, DNA transformation requires presence short DNA sequences monomers residing coding regions donor DNA. These sequences called DNA uptake sequences DUSs. Specific recognition DUSs mediated type IV pilin. Davidsen et al. reported N. meningitidis N. gonorrhoeae, DUSs occur significantly higher density genes involved DNA repair recombination well restrictionmodification replication annotated gene groups. These authors proposed overrepresentation DUS DNA repair recombination genes may reflect benefit maintaining integrity DNA repair recombination machinery preferentially taking genome maintenance genes could replace damaged counterparts recipient cell. Caugant Maiden noted distribution DUS consistent recombination primarily mechanism genome repair occasionally result generation diversity, even occasionally, adaptive. It also suggested Michod et al. important benefit transformation N. gonorrhoeae recombinational repair oxidative DNA damages caused oxidative attack hosts phagocytic cells. The International Pathogenic Neisseria Conference IPNC, occurring every two years, forum presentation cuttingedge research aspects genus Neisseria. This includes immunology, vaccinology, physiology metabolism N. meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae commensal species. The first IPNC took place , recent one September . Normally, location conference switches North America Europe, took place Australia first time , venue located Cairns.
