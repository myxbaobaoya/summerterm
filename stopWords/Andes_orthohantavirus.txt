Andes orthohantavirus ANDV species Orthohantavirus major causative agent hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome HCPS hantavirus pulmonary syndrome HPS South America It named Andes mountains Chile Argentina first discovered Originating reservoir rodents Andes orthohantavirus easily transmitted humans come contact infected rodents fecal droppings However infected rodents appear ill readily apparent indicator determine whether rodent infected Additionally Andes orthohantavirus specifically hantavirus spread human human contact via bodily fluids longterm contact one infected individual healthy person Andes orthohantavirus first identified outbreaks new infection spread throughout Chile Argentina In finally characterized Argentina basis specimens patient died HPS complications severe consequence infection Andes viruses As emerging virus lethal hantaviruses mortality rate South America By far responsible recorded cases HPS Argentina Chile Uruguay combined contributes large number kidney failure cases Although carried humans rodents Andes orthohantavirus commonly found Oligoryzomys longicaudatus species pygmy rat native ChileArgentina region cases Abrothrix longipilis longhaired grass mouse Andes orthohantavirus species Hantavirus group enveloped Negativesense singlestranded RNA virus belonging family Hantaviridae The family consists genera bunyavirus phlebovirus nairovirus tospovirus hantavirus All genera excluding hantavirus airborne viruses hantavirus rodentborne Transmission hantaviruses aerosol exposure rodent bodily fluids Additionally Hantaviruses seem cause detectable cytopathology vertebrate cell cultures The spherical virion Hantavirus typically nm long contains segmented singlestranded genome The trisegmented genome includes S small M medium L large segment code nucleocapsid N glycoproteins G G L protein respectively The S segment Andes virus contains nucleotides total encoding nucleotidelong N protein Upon comparison S M segments variants Andes virus found form lineage viruses ESQ H CH H Bayou Black Creek Canal viruses When expressed M segment generates glycoprotein precursor GPC cleaved envelope Gn Gc proteins The L protein encoded L segment possesses enzymatic functions involved within transcription replication In addition segments virion also contains RdRP enclosed envelope Unlike four genera family hantavirion segments also contain complementary terminal nucleotide sequence terminal sequence These nucleotide sequences AUCAUCAUCUG ′ end UAGUAGUAUGC ′ end The Hantavirus replication takes place strictly cytoplasm host cell primarily targeting endothelial cells During early infection Andes virus produce weak innate immune response cell The entry uncoating virus begins virion attaches cell receptors surface host cell brings virus via endocytosis By process called pHdependent fusion virion endosomal membrane nucleocapsids enter cytoplasm The virus genome contains RNAdependent RNA polymerase RdRp directs transcription replication viral genome Once nucleocapsids released RdRp initiates transcription binding encapsidated segments While M segment mRNAs translated membranebound ribosomes L S segment mRNAs translated free ribosomes Once transcribed mRNA capped L proteins via Cap snatching These capped RNA fragments transferred L protein trimmed length endonuclease used RdRp initiate viral mRNA synthesis Replication terminated plasma membrane begins fuse cytoplasmic vesicles mature virions released Initial signs Andes orthohantavirus infection easily mistaken flu Signs symptoms appear early days weeks exposure The way diagnose Andes orthohantavirus cause symptoms testing patients blood Andes orthohantavirus genetic material corresponding antibodies Andes orthohantavirus Individuals typically infectious showing symptoms one following Although two possible vectors virus humans rodents multiple routes infection aware These include Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome acute severe sometimes fatal respiratory disease caused infection Andes orthohantavirus Four ten days initial symptoms begin respiratory symptoms indicating HPS appear Such symptoms include muscle aches fatigue shortness breath fever HPS symptoms develop quickly therefore imperative seek healthcare immediately Early care beneficial patient vaccine specific treatment HPS In extreme cases infected individuals may intubated receive oxygen therapy Although hantavirus infections prevalent United States currently recorded cases HPS due infection Andes virus United States rest North America however several cases reported Chile Argentina HCPS result Andes orthohantavirus infection case fatality rate – Argentina Chile ANDV lineage ANDVSout hantavirus persontoperson transmission described human hantavirus infections transmitted exclusively animals humans Several ANDV strains cocirculating Argentina eg Bermejo Lechiguanas Maciel Oran Pergamino HCPS cases also reported nearby Bolivia Brazil Paraguay Uruguay Chile Argentina strictly associated ANDV In Argentina Chile longtailed rice rat Oligoryzomys longicaudatus species genus Oligoryzomys documented reservoir ANDV Another unique characteristic ANDV availability animal model ANDV causes lethal disease Syrian hamster Mesocricetus auratus closely models course disease progression humans including rapid progression first symptoms death characterized fluid pleural cavity histopathology lungs spleen Lethality ANDV hamsters true viruses causing HCPS hamsters infected Sin Nombre virus example show symptoms disease The availability model allows study various drugs treatments may affect treatment HCPScausing hantavirus infections When visiting geographical locations Andes orthohantavirus documented South America people avoid areas high rodent populations virus likely found transmitted quickly easily rodent next Properly disinfecting living spaces areas rodents may present kill virus able contracted To prevent transmission contact infected humans individuals infected handwash frequently abstain kissing sexual activity one another avoid sharing spaces close confinement long periods time There current treatment cure vaccine available illness caused Andes virus However patients seek medical attention quickly early symptoms abated intensive care intubation necessary patients severe breathing difficulties
