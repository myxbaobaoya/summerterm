Bacteria formerly known "Actinomyces naeslundi genospecies " reclassified new species name Actinomyces oris. Those formerly known "Actinomyces naeslundi genospecies WVA " reclassified Actinomyces johnsonii. Many species genus Actinomyces, including A. naeslundii, cause chronic disease called actinomycosis, characterized swelling formation abscess may exude pus. This accompanied tissue fibrosis.
