Mayaro virus disease mosquitoborne zoonotic pathogen endemic certain humid forests tropical South America Infection Mayaro virus causes acute selflimited denguelike illness â€“ days duration The causative virus abbreviated MAYV family Togaviridae genus Alphavirus It closely related alphaviruses produce denguelike illness accompanied longlasting arthralgia It known circulate tropical South America Mayaro virus structure similar alphaviruses It enveloped virus icosahedral capsid diameter nm The virus genome composed linear positivesense singlestranded RNA nucleotides excluding cap nucleotide polyA tail The MAYV RNA genome contains untranslated region noncoding region two open reading frames ORFs The proximal proximal ORFs separated short noncoding sequence represent twothirds onethird genomic RNA respectively The proximal ORF codes polyprotein cleavage forms nonstructural proteins nsP nsP nsP nsP proximal ORF S promoter codes polyprotein cleaved structural proteins generate capsid proteins envelope surface glycoproteins E E E C K The nonstructural proteins nsP play different functions virus cycle The nsP mRNAcapping enzyme nsP protease activity nsP RNAdirect RNA polymerase The structural polyprotein cleaved six chains capsid protein C p E protein spike glycoprotein E E envelope glycoprotein spike glycoprotein E K protein E envelope glycoprotein known also spike glycoprotein E The envelope lipid component critical virus particle stability infectivity mammalian cells Once virus enters host cell genomic RNA released cytoplasm two ORFs translated proteins synthesis negativestranded RNA starts A consecutive synthesis positivestranded RNA takes place The MAYV sequences analysis showed two genotypes D L The amplicon used phylogenetic analysis includes E E glycoprotein genes NCR The genotype D distributed Trinidad Brazil French Guiana Surinam Peru Bolivia genotype L limited northcentral region Brazil The MAYV infection characterized fever headache myalgia rash prominent pain large joints association rheumatic disease signs symptoms unspecific distinguish arboviruses The MAYV infection confirmed laboratory testing virus isolation RTPCR serology The virus isolation cell culture effective viremia RTPCR helps identify virus Serology tests detect antibodies like IgM common assay IgMcapture enzymelinked immunosorbant assays ELISA This test usually requires consecutive retest confirm increasing titers While IgG detection applied epidemiology studies The viruss transmission cycle wild similar continuous sylvatic cycle yellow fever believed involve wild primates monkeys natural reservoir tree canopydwelling Haemagogus species mosquito vector Human infections strongly associated exposure humid tropical forest environments Chikungunya virus closely related producing nearly indistinguishable highly debilitating arthralgic disease On February Portugueselanguage news source reported recent survey revealed Mayaro virus activity Manaus Amazonas State Brazil The survey studied blood samples residents Manaus experienced high fever Mayaro virus identified cases Four cases experienced mild hemorrhagic bleeding symptoms previously described Mayaro virus disease The report stated outbreak first detected metropolitan setting expressed concern disease might adapting urban species mosquito vectors would make risk spreading within country A study published demonstrated colonized strain Brazilian Aedes albopictus capable acquiring MAYV infected hamsters subsequently transmitting another study demonstrated A aegypti transmit MAYV supporting possibility wider transmission Mayaro virus disease urban settings A study demonstrated A aegypti Culex quinquefasciatus inefficient MAYV vectors Anopheles freeborni Anopheles gambiae Anopheles quadrimaculatus Anopheles stephensi able transmit MAYV three four capable transmitting two genotypes The tested Anopheles species native Africa Asia North America suggesting Anopheles spp could play significant role dissemination establishment MAYV diverse regions world An outbreak Chuquisaca Department Bolivia involving persons reported May In January French tourist developed highgrade fever severe joint pain manifestations following day trip Amazon basin Brazil diagnosed MAYV infection France This case first reported traveler returning endemic South American country Europe Mayaro virus disease also transported United States two visitors infected eastern Peru Netherlands couple infected vacationing Surinam The first outbreak Mayaro virus disease humans Venezuela reported early June cases diagnosed Ospino Portuguesa state additional two San Fernando de Apure Apure state June total reported cases June A single case Mayaro virus child Haiti confirmed In cases reported Peru Ecuador Research suggested macrophage migration inhibitory factor plays critical role determining clinical severity alphavirusinduced musculoskeletal disease may provide target development antiviral pharmaceuticals Mayaro virus alphaviruses affect human beings Ross River virus chikungunya Sindbis virus Onyongnyong virus
