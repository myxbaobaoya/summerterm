Cowpox infectious disease caused cowpox virus CPXV It presents large blisters skin fever swollen glands typically following contact infected cow The hands face frequently affected spots generally painful The virus part genus Orthopoxvirus closely related vaccinia virus The virus zoonotic meaning transferable species cat human The transferral disease first observed dairymaids touched udders infected cows consequently developed signature pustules hands Cowpox commonly found animals bovines rodents Cowpox similar much milder highly contagious often deadly smallpox disease Its close resemblance mild form smallpox observation dairy farmers immune smallpox inspired modern smallpox vaccine created administered English physician Edward Jenner The first description cowpox given Jenner "Vaccination" derived Latin adjective vaccinus meaning "of cow" Once vaccinated patient develops antibodies make immune cowpox also develop immunity smallpox virus Variola virus The cowpox vaccinations later incarnations proved successful World Health Organization announced smallpox first disease eradicated vaccination efforts worldwide Other orthopox viruses remain prevalent certain communities continue infect humans cowpox virus Europe vaccinia Brazil monkeypox virus Central West Africacitation needed Naturally occurring cases cowpox common discovered vaccine could carried humans reproduced disseminated humantohuman Jenners original vaccination used lymph cowpox pustule milkmaid subsequent armtoarm vaccinations applied principle As transfer human fluids came set complications safer manner producing vaccine first introduced Italy The new method used cows manufacture vaccine using process called retrovaccination" heifer inoculated humanized cowpox virus passed calf calf produce massive quantities efficiently safely This led next incarnation true animal vaccine used process began naturallyoccurring cowpox virus humanized formcitation needed This method production proved lucrative taken advantage many entrepreneurs needing calves seed lymph infected cow manufacture crude versions vaccine W F Elgin National Vaccine Establishment presented slightly refined technique Conference State Provincial Boards Health North America A tuberculosisfree calf stomach shaved would bound operating table incisions would made lower body Glycerinated lymph previously inoculated calf spread along cuts After days cuts would scabbed crusted The crust softened sterilized water mixed glycerin disinfected stored hermeticallysealed capillary tubes later usecitation needed At point virus use longer cowpox vaccinia Scientists determined exactly change mutation occurred effects vaccinia cowpox virus vaccine nearly The virus found Europe mainly UK Human cases today rare often contracted domestic cats The virus commonly found cattle reservoir hosts virus woodland rodents particularly voles From rodents domestic cats contract transmit virus humans Symptoms cats include lesions face neck forelimbs paws less commonly upper respiratory tract infections Symptoms infection cowpox virus humans localized pustular lesions generally found hands limited site introductioncitation needed The incubation period dayscitation needed The virus prevalent late summer autumncitation needed In years least six people contact cow independently tested possibility using cowpox vaccine immunization smallpox humans Among English farmer Benjamin Jesty Dorset German teacher Peter Plett Jesty inoculated wife two young sons cowpox successful effort immunize smallpox epidemic arisen town His patients contracted recovered similar milder cowpox mainly milkmaids seemed immune cases cowpox also smallpox By scratching fluid cowpox lesions skin healthy individuals able immunize people smallpox Reportedly farmers people working regularly cattle horses often spared smallpox outbreaks Investigations British Army showed horsemounted troops less infected smallpox infantry due probable exposure similar horsepox virus Variola equina By early th century people Great Britain vaccinated The armtoarm method transfer cowpox vaccine also used distribute Jenners vaccine throughout Spanish Empire Spanish king Charles IVs daughter stricken smallpox recovered arranged rest family vaccinated In king convinced benefits vaccine ordered personal physician Francis Xavier de Balmis deliver Spanish dominions North South America To maintain vaccine available state voyage physician recruited young boys never cowpox smallpox aged three nine years orphanages Spain During trip across Atlantic de Balmis vaccinated orphans living chain Two children vaccinated immediately departure cowpox pustules appeared arms material lesions used vaccinate two children In English medical practitioner Edward Jenner tested theory cowpox could protect someone infected smallpox There long speculation regarding origins Jenners variolae vaccinae DNA sequencing data showed close similarities horsepox cowpox viruses Jenner noted farriers sometimes milked cows material equine disease could produce vesicular disease cows variolae vaccinae derived Contemporary accounts provide support Jenners speculation vaccine probably originated equine disease called "grease" Although cowpox originates udder cows Jenner took sample milkmaid Sarah Nelmes Jenner extracted pus one lesions formed cowpox Nelmes James Phipps eightyearold boy never smallpox He eventually developed scab fever manageable Approximately six weeks later Jenner introduced active sample smallpox virus Phipps test theory After observed extended amount time recorded Phipps receive reaction Although Jenner first person conceive notion cowpox protecting smallpox virus experiment proved theory It later discovered cowpox vaccination worked temporarily invasion smallpox procedure would need repeated several times ones lifetime remain smallpox freecitation needed In later years Jenner popularized experiment calling vaccination Latin cow vacca The amount vaccinations among people era increased drastically It widely considered relatively safer procedure compared mainstream inoculation Although Jenner propelled spotlight vaccination popularity mainly focused science behind cowpox allowed persons infected smallpox The honour discovery vaccination often attributed Benjamin Jesty scientist repeat publish findings He considered first use cowpox vaccination though term vaccination invented yet During midst smallpox outbreak Jesty transferred pieces cow udder knew infected cowpox skin family members hopes protecting Jesty publicize findings Jenner performed first inoculation years later publicized findings assumed credit It said Jenner made discovery possibly without knowing previous accounts years earlier Although Jesty may first discover Jenner made vaccination widely accessible therefore credited invention The majority population time accepted upandcoming vaccination However still opposition individuals reluctant change inoculations In addition became growing concern parties worried unknown repercussions infecting human animal disease One way individuals expressed discontent draw comics sometimes depicted small cows growing sites vaccination Others publicly advocated continuance inoculations however discontent vaccinations Some reluctance apprehensiveness change They become familiar process outcome positives negatives inoculations want surprised outcome effects vaccinations Jenner soon eased minds extensive trials However others advocated vaccinations different reason Because high price inoculation Jenner experienced common folk willing accept vaccination Due Jenner found many subjects tests He able publish results pamphlet An Inquiry Causes Effects Variolae Vaccinae Disease Discovered Western Counties England particularly Gloucestershire known Name Cow Pox After inoculation vaccination using cowpox virus became primary defense smallpox After infection cowpox virus body usually gains ability recognize similar smallpox virus antigens able fight smallpox disease much efficientlycitation needed The cowpox virus contains thousand base pairs DNA contains information genes This makes cowpox one complicated viruses known Some genes give instructions key parts human immune system giving clue closely related smallpox lethal The vaccinia virus used smallpox vaccination sufficiently different cowpox virus found wild considered separate virus While vaccinations popularity increased exponentially monetary value This realized British Parliament compensated Jenner pounds vaccination In addition later compensated Jenner additional pounds In coming years Jenner continued advocacy vaccination still popular inoculation Eventually inoculation became banned England replaced cowpox vaccination main medical solution combat smallpox The cowpox vaccination saved British Army thousands soldiers making immune effects smallpox upcoming wars The cowpox also saved United Kingdom thousands pounds Kinepox alternative term smallpox vaccine used early thcentury America Popularized Jenner late kinepox far safer method inoculating people smallpox previous method variolation fatality ratecitation needed In famous letter Meriwether Lewis Thomas Jefferson instructed Lewis Clark expedition "carry matter kinepox inform may efficacy preservative smallpox encourage use it" Jefferson developed interest protecting American Indians smallpox aware epidemics along Missouri River previous century A year special instructions Lewis Jefferson persuaded visiting delegation North American Indian chieftains vaccinated kinepox winter â€“ Unfortunately Lewis never got opportunity use kinepox pairs expedition become inadvertently inactivea common occurrence time vaccines stabilized preservatives glycerol kept refrigeration temperatures Today virus found Europe mainly UK Human cases rare though laboratory worker contracted cowpox often contracted domestic cats Human infections usually remain localized selflimiting become fatal immunosuppressed patients The virus commonly found cattle reservoir hosts virus woodland rodents particularly voles Domestic cats contract virus rodents Symptoms cats include lesions face neck forelimbs paws less commonly upper respiratory tract infections Symptoms infection cowpox virus humans localized pustular lesions generally found hands limited site introduction The incubation period nine ten days The virus prevalent late summer autumn Immunity cowpox gained smallpox vaccine
