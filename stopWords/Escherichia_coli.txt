Escherichia coli ˌɛʃəˈrɪkiə ˈkoʊlaɪ, also known E. coli ˌiː ˈkoʊlaɪ, Gramnegative, facultative anaerobic, rodshaped, coliform bacterium genus Escherichia commonly found lower intestine warmblooded organisms. Most E. coli strains harmless, serotypes EPEC, ETEC etc. cause serious food poisoning hosts, occasionally responsible food contamination incidents prompt product recalls. The harmless strains part normal microbiota gut, benefit hosts producing vitamin K, preventing colonisation intestine pathogenic bacteria, mutualistic relationship. E. coli expelled environment within fecal matter. The bacterium grows massively fresh fecal matter aerobic conditions three days, numbers decline slowly afterwards. E. coli facultative anaerobes constitute . gut microbiota, fecal–oral transmission major route pathogenic strains bacterium cause disease. Cells able survive outside body limited amount time, makes potential indicator organisms test environmental samples fecal contamination. A growing body research, though, examined environmentally persistent E. coli survive many days grow outside host. The bacterium grown cultured easily inexpensively laboratory setting, intensively investigated years. E. coli chemoheterotroph whose chemically defined medium must include source carbon energy. E. coli widely studied prokaryotic model organism, important species fields biotechnology microbiology, served host organism majority work recombinant DNA. Under favorable conditions, takes little minutes reproduce. E. coli Gramnegative, facultative anaerobe, nonsporulating coliform bacterium. Cells typically rodshaped, . μm long .–. μm diameter, cell volume .–. μm. Antibiotics effectively treat E. coli infections outside digestive tract intestinal infections used treat intestinal infections one strain bacteria. The flagella allow bacteria swim peritrichous arrangement. It also attaches effaces microvilli intestines via adhesion molecule known intimin. E. coli live wide variety substrates uses mixed acid fermentation anaerobic conditions, producing lactate, succinate, ethanol, acetate, carbon dioxide. Since many pathways mixedacid fermentation produce hydrogen gas, pathways require levels hydrogen low, case E. coli lives together hydrogenconsuming organisms, methanogens sulphatereducing bacteria. In addition, E. coli's metabolism rewired solely use CO source carbon biomass production. In words, obligate heterotroph's metabolism altered display autotrophic capabilities heterologously expressing carbon fixation genes well formate dehydrogenase conducting laboratory evolution experiments. This may done using formate reduce electron carriers supply ATP required anabolic pathways inside synthetic autotrophs. E. coli three native glycolytic pathways: EMPP, EDP, OPPP. The EMPP employs ten enzymatic steps yield two pyruvates, two ATP, two NADH per glucose molecule OPPP serves oxidation route NADPH synthesis. Although EDP thermodynamically favorable three pathways, E. coli use EDP glucose metabolism, relying mainly EMPP OPPP. The EDP mainly remains inactive except growth gluconate. When growing presence mixture sugars, bacteria often consume sugars sequentially process known catabolite repression. By repressing expression genes involved metabolizing less preferred sugars, cells usually first consume sugar yielding highest growth rate, followed sugar yielding next highest growth rate, on. In cells ensure limited metabolic resources used maximize rate growth. The wellused example E. coli involves growth bacterium glucose lactose, E. coli consume glucose lactose. Catabolite repression also observed E. coli presence nonglucose sugars, arabinose xylose, sorbitol, rhamnose, ribose. In E. coli, glucose catabolite repression regulated phosphotransferase system, multiprotein phosphorylation cascade couples glucose uptake metabolism. Optimum growth E. coli occurs °C °F, laboratory strains multiply temperatures °C °F. E. coli grows variety defined laboratory media, lysogeny broth, medium contains glucose, ammonium phosphate monobasic, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate dibasic, water. Growth driven aerobic anaerobic respiration, using large variety redox pairs, including oxidation pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, amino acids, reduction substrates oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide, trimethylamine Noxide. E. coli classified facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen present available. It can, however, continue grow absence oxygen using fermentation anaerobic respiration. The ability continue growing absence oxygen advantage bacteria survival increased environments water predominates. The bacterial cell cycle divided three stages. The B period occurs completion cell division beginning DNA replication. The C period encompasses time takes replicate chromosomal DNA. The D period refers stage conclusion DNA replication end cell division. The doubling rate E. coli higher nutrients available. However, length C D periods change, even doubling time becomes less sum C D periods. At fastest growth rates, replication begins previous round replication completed, resulting multiple replication forks along DNA overlapping cell cycles. The number replication forks fast growing E. coli typically follows n n , . This happens replication initiated simultaneously origins replications, referred synchronous replication. However, cells culture replicate synchronously. In case cells multiples two replication forks. Replication initiation referred asynchronous. However, asynchrony caused mutations instance DnaA DnaA initiatorassociating protein DiaA. E. coli related bacteria possess ability transfer DNA via bacterial conjugation transduction, allows genetic material spread horizontally existing population. The process transduction, uses bacterial virus called bacteriophage, spread gene encoding Shiga toxin Shigella bacteria E. coli helped produce E. coli O:H, Shiga toxinproducing strain E. coli. E. coli encompasses enormous population bacteria exhibit high degree genetic phenotypic diversity. Genome sequencing many isolates E. coli related bacteria shows taxonomic reclassification would desirable. However, done, largely due medical importance, E. coli remains one diverse bacterial species: genes typical E. coli genome shared among strains. In fact, constructive point view, members genus Shigella S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, S. sonnei classified E. coli strains, phenomenon termed taxa disguise. Similarly, strains E. coli e.g. K strain commonly used recombinant DNA work sufficiently different would merit reclassification. A strain subgroup within species unique characteristics distinguish strains. These differences often detectable molecular level; however, may result changes physiology lifecycle bacterium. For example, strain may gain pathogenic capacity, ability use unique carbon source, ability take upon particular ecological niche, ability resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains E. coli often hostspecific, making possible determine source fecal contamination environmental samples. For example, knowing E. coli strains present water sample allows researchers make assumptions whether contamination originated human, another mammal, bird.A common subdivision system E. coli, based evolutionary relatedness, serotype, based major surface antigens O antigen: part lipopolysaccharide layer; H: flagellin; K antigen: capsule, e.g. O:H. It is, however, common cite serogroup, i.e. Oantigen. At present, serogroups known. The common laboratory strain mutation prevents formation Oantigen thus typeable. Like lifeforms, new strains E. coli evolve natural biological processes mutation, gene duplication, horizontal gene transfer; particular, genome laboratory strain MG horizontally acquired since divergence Salmonella. E. coli K E. coli B strains frequently used varieties laboratory purposes. Some strains develop traits harmful host animal. These virulent strains typically cause bout diarrhea often selflimiting healthy adults frequently lethal children developing world. More virulent strains, O:H, cause serious illness death elderly, young, immunocompromised. The genera Escherichia Salmonella diverged around million years ago credibility interval: – mya, event unrelated much earlier see Synapsid divergence hosts: former found mammals latter birds reptiles. This followed split Escherichia ancestor five species E. albertii, E. coli, E. fergusonii, E. hermannii, E. vulneris. The last E. coli ancestor split million years ago. The longterm evolution experiments using E. coli, begun Richard Lenski , allowed direct observation genome evolution , generations laboratory. For instance, E. coli typically ability grow aerobically citrate carbon source, used diagnostic criterion differentiate E. coli other, closely, related bacteria Salmonella. In experiment, one population E. coli unexpectedly evolved ability aerobically metabolize citrate, major evolutionary shift hallmarks microbial speciation.In microbial world, relationship predation established similar observed animal world. Considered, seen E. coli prey multiple generalist predators, Myxococcus xanthus. In predatorprey relationship, parallel evolution species observed genomic phenotypic modifications, case E. coli modifications modified two aspects involved virulence mucoid production excessive production exoplasmic acid alginate suppression OmpT gene, producing future generations better adaptation one species counteracted evolution other, following coevolutionary model demonstrated Red Queen hypothesis. E. coli type species genus Escherichia turn Escherichia type genus family Enterobacteriaceae, family name stem genus Enterobacter "i" sic. "aceae", "enterobacterium" "aceae" enterobacterium genus, alternative trivial name enteric bacterium. The original strain described Escherich believed lost, consequently new type strain neotype chosen representative: neotype strain UT, also known deposit names DSM , ATCC , NCTC , pathogenic chickens O:K:H serotype. However, studies, either O:H, K MG, K W used representative E. coli. The genome type strain lately sequenced. Many strains belonging species isolated characterised. In addition serotype vide supra, classified according phylogeny, i.e. inferred evolutionary history, shown species divided six groups. Particularly use whole genome sequences yields highly supported phylogenies. Based data, five subspecies E. coli distinguished. The link phylogenetic distance "relatedness" pathology small, e.g. O:H serotype strains, form clade "an exclusive group"group E beloware enterohaemorragic strains EHEC, EHEC strains closely related. In fact, four different species Shigella nested among E. coli strains vide supra, E. albertii E. fergusonii outside group. Indeed, Shigella species placed within single subspecies E. coli phylogenomic study included type strain, reason according reclassification difficult. All commonly used research strains E. coli belong group A derived mainly Clifton's K strain λ F; O lesser degree d'Herelle's Bacillus coli strain B strain O.

It circular DNA molecule . million base pairs length, containing annotated proteincoding genes organized operons, seven ribosomal RNA rRNA operons, transfer RNA tRNA genes. Despite subject intensive genetic analysis years, many genes previously unknown. The coding density found high, mean distance genes base pairs. The genome observed contain significant number transposable genetic elements, repeat elements, cryptic prophages, bacteriophage remnants. More three hundred complete genomic sequences Escherichia Shigella species known. The genome sequence type strain E. coli added collection . Comparison sequences shows remarkable amount diversity; genome represents sequences present every one isolates, around genome vary among isolates. Each individual genome contains , , genes, total number different genes among sequenced E. coli strains pangenome exceeds ,. This large variety component genes interpreted mean twothirds E. coli pangenome originated species arrived process horizontal gene transfer. Genes E. coli usually named accordance uniform nomenclature proposed Demerec et al. Gene names letter acronyms derive function known mutant phenotype italicized. When multiple genes acronym, different genes designated capital later follows acronym also italicized. For instance, recA named role homologous recombination plus letter A. Functionally related genes named recB, recC, recD etc. The proteins named uppercase acronyms, e.g. RecA, RecB, etc. When genome E. coli strain K substr. MG sequenced, known predicted proteincoding genes numbered less order genome abbreviated b numbers, b recD. The "b" names created Fred Blattner, led genome sequence effort. Another numbering system introduced sequence another E. coli K substrain, W, sequenced Japan hence uses numbers starting JW... Japanese W, e.g. JW recD. Hence, recD b JW. Note, however, databases numbering system, e.g. EcoGene database uses EG recD. Finally, ECK numbers specifically used alleles MG strain E. coli K. Complete lists genes synonyms obtained databases EcoGene Uniprot. The genome sequence E. coli predicts proteincoding genes, percent initially attributed function. Comparison five sequenced microbes reveals ubiquitous well narrowly distributed gene families; many families similar genes within E. coli also evident. The largest family paralogous proteins contains ABC transporters. The genome whole strikingly organized respect local direction replication; guanines, oligonucleotides possibly related replication recombination, genes oriented. The genome also contains insertion sequence IS elements, phage remnants, many patches unusual composition indicating genome plasticity horizontal transfer. Several studies experimentally investigated proteome E. coli. By , , predicted proteins open reading frames, ORFs identified experimentally. Mateus et al. detected , proteins least peptides proteins. Although much fewer bacterial proteins seem posttranslational modifications PTMs compared eukaryotic proteins, substantial number proteins modified E. coli. For instance, Potel et al. found phosphoproteins phosphorylated histidine. Interestingly, majority phosphorylated amino acids serine , sites sites histidine phosphorylated theronines tyrosines. The interactome E. coli studied affinity purification mass spectrometry APMS analyzing binary interactions among proteins. Protein complexes. A study purified , proteins cultures strain K found interacting partners , proteins, many unknown functions time. A study found , interactions proteins E. coli strain, though data showed little overlap publication. Binary interactions. Rajagopala et al. carried systematic yeast twohybrid screens E. coli proteins, found total , proteinprotein interactions. This study also integrated genetic interactions protein structures mapped interactions within protein complexes. E. coli belongs group bacteria informally known coliforms found gastrointestinal tract warmblooded animals. E. coli normally colonizes infant's gastrointestinal tract within hours birth, arriving food water individuals handling child. In bowel, E. coli adheres mucus large intestine. It primary facultative anaerobe human gastrointestinal tract. Facultative anaerobes organisms grow either presence absence oxygen. As long bacteria acquire genetic elements encoding virulence factors, remain benign commensals. Due low cost speed grown modified laboratory settings, E. coli popular expression platform production recombinant proteins used therapeutics. One advantage using E. coli another expression platform E. coli naturally export many proteins periplasm, making easier recover protein interest without crosscontamination. The E. coli K strains derivatives DH, DHα, MG, RV W strains widely used biotechnology industry. Nonpathogenic E. coli strain Nissle EcN, Mutaflor E. coli O:K:H Colinfant used probiotic agents medicine, mainly treatment various gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. It thought EcN strain might impede growth opportunistic pathogens, including Salmonella coliform enteropathogens, production microcin proteins production siderophores. Most E. coli strains cause disease, naturally living gut, virulent strains cause gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, neonatal meningitis, hemorrhagic colitis, Crohn's disease.citation needed Common signs symptoms include severe abdominal cramps, diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, vomiting, sometimes fever. In rarer cases, virulent strains also responsible bowel necrosis tissue death perforation without progressing hemolyticuremic syndrome, peritonitis, mastitis, sepsis, Gramnegative pneumonia. Very young children susceptible develop severe illness, hemolytic uremic syndrome; however, healthy individuals ages risk severe consequences may arise result infected E. coli. Some strains E. coli, example O:H, produce Shiga toxin classified bioterrorism agent. The Shiga toxin causes inflammatory responses target cells gut, leaving behind lesions result bloody diarrhea symptom Shiga toxinproducing E. coli STEC infection. This toxin causes premature destruction red blood cells, clog body's filtering system, kidneys, rare cases usually children elderly causing hemolyticuremic syndrome HUS, may lead kidney failure even death. Signs hemolytic uremic syndrome include decreased frequency urination, lethargy, paleness cheeks inside lower eyelids. In HUS patients, complications nervous system occur, turn causes strokes. In addition, strain causes buildup fluid since kidneys work, leading edema around lungs, legs, arms. This increase fluid buildup especially around lungs impedes functioning heart, causing increase blood pressure. Uropathogenic E. coli UPEC one main causes urinary tract infections. It part normal microbiota gut introduced many ways. In particular females, direction wiping defecation wiping back front lead fecal contamination urogenital orifices. Anal intercourse also introduce bacterium male urethra, switching anal vaginal intercourse, male also introduce UPEC female urogenital system. Enterotoxigenic E. coli ETEC common cause traveler's diarrhea, many million cases worldwide developing countries year. The bacteria, typically transmitted contaminated food drinking water, adheres intestinal lining, secretes either two types enterotoxins, leading watery diarrhea. The rate severity infections higher among children age five, including many , deaths annually. In May , one E. coli strain, O:H, subject bacterial outbreak began Germany. Certain strains E. coli major cause foodborne illness. The outbreak started several people Germany infected enterohemorrhagic E. coli EHEC bacteria, leading hemolyticuremic syndrome HUS, medical emergency requires urgent treatment. The outbreak concern Germany, also countries, including regions North America. On June , German Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung BfR Federal Institute Risk Assessment, federal institute within German Federal Ministry Food, Agriculture Consumer Protection announced seeds fenugreek Egypt likely cause EHEC outbreak. Some studies demonstrated absence E. coli gut flora subjects metabolic disorder Phenylketonuria. It hypothesized absence normal bacterium impairs production key vitamins B riboflavin K menaquinone vitamins implicated many physiological roles humans cellular bone metabolism contributes disorder. Carbapenemresistant E. coli carbapenemaseproducing E. coli resistant carbapenem class antibiotics, considered drugs last resort infections. They resistant produce enzyme called carbapenemase disables drug molecule. The time ingesting STEC bacteria feeling sick called "incubation period". The incubation period usually – days exposure, may short day long days. The symptoms often begin slowly mild belly pain nonbloody diarrhea worsens several days. HUS, occurs, develops average days first symptoms, diarrhea improving. Diagnosis infectious diarrhea identification antimicrobial resistance performed using stool culture subsequent antibiotic sensitivity testing. It requires minimum days maximum several weeks culture gastrointestinal pathogens. The sensitivity true positive specificity true negative rates stool culture vary pathogen, although number human pathogens cultured. For culturepositive samples, antimicrobial resistance testing takes additional – hours perform. Current point care molecular diagnostic tests identify E. coli antimicrobial resistance identified strains much faster culture sensitivity testing. Microarraybased platforms identify specific pathogenic strains E. coli E. colispecific AMR genes two hours less high sensitivity specificity, size test panel i.e., total pathogens antimicrobial resistance genes limited. Newer metagenomicsbased infectious disease diagnostic platforms currently developed overcome various limitations culture currently available molecular diagnostic technologies. The mainstay treatment assessment dehydration replacement fluid electrolytes. Administration antibiotics shown shorten course illness duration excretion enterotoxigenic E. coli ETEC adults endemic areas traveller's diarrhea, though rate resistance commonly used antibiotics increasing generally recommended. The antibiotic used depends upon susceptibility patterns particular geographical region. Currently, antibiotics choice fluoroquinolones azithromycin, emerging role rifaximin. Oral rifaximin, semisynthetic rifamycin derivative, effective welltolerated antibacterial management adults noninvasive traveller's diarrhea. Rifaximin significantly effective placebo less effective ciprofloxacin reducing duration diarrhea. While rifaximin effective patients E. colipredominant traveller's diarrhea, appears ineffective patients infected inflammatory invasive enteropathogens. ETEC type E. coli vaccine development efforts focused on. Antibodies LT major CFs ETEC provide protection LTproducing, ETECexpressing homologous CFs. Oral inactivated vaccines consisting toxin antigen whole cells, i.e. licensed recombinant cholera B subunit rCTBWC cholera vaccine Dukoral, developed. There currently licensed vaccines ETEC, though several various stages development. In different trials, rCTBWC cholera vaccine provided high – shortterm protection. An oral ETEC vaccine candidate consisting rCTB formalin inactivated E. coli bacteria expressing major CFs shown clinical trials safe, immunogenic, effective severe diarrhoea American travelers ETEC diarrhoea young children Egypt. A modified ETEC vaccine consisting recombinant E. coli strains overexpressing major CFs LTlike hybrid toxoid called LCTBA, undergoing clinical testing. Other proven prevention methods E. coli transmission include handwashing improved sanitation drinking water, transmission occurs fecal contamination food water supplies. Additionally, thoroughly cooking meat avoiding consumption raw, unpasteurized beverages, juices milk proven methods preventing E. coli. Lastly, avoid crosscontamination utensils work spaces preparing food. Because long history laboratory culture ease manipulation, E. coli plays important role modern biological engineering industrial microbiology. The work Stanley Norman Cohen Herbert Boyer E. coli, using plasmids restriction enzymes create recombinant DNA, became foundation biotechnology. E. coli versatile host production heterologous proteins, various protein expression systems developed allow production recombinant proteins E. coli. Researchers introduce genes microbes using plasmids permit high level expression protein, protein may massproduced industrial fermentation processes. One first useful applications recombinant DNA technology manipulation E. coli produce human insulin. Many proteins previously thought difficult impossible expressed E. coli folded form successfully expressed E. coli. For example, proteins multiple disulphide bonds may produced periplasmic space cytoplasm mutants rendered sufficiently oxidizing allow disulphidebonds form, proteins requiring posttranslational modification glycosylation stability function expressed using Nlinked glycosylation system Campylobacter jejuni engineered E. coli. Modified E. coli cells used vaccine development, bioremediation, production biofuels, lighting, production immobilised enzymes. Strain K mutant form E. coli overexpresses enzyme Alkaline Phosphatase ALP. The mutation arises due defect gene constantly codes enzyme. A gene producing product without inhibition said constitutive activity. This particular mutant form used isolate purify aforementioned enzyme. Strain OP Escherichia coli used maintenance Caenorhabditis elegans cultures. Strain JM mutant form E. coli recA endA deficient. The strain utilized bluewhite screening cells carry fertility factor episome. Lack recA decreases possibility unwanted restriction DNA interest lack endA inhibit plasmid DNA decomposition. Thus, JM useful cloning expression systems. E. coli frequently used model organism microbiology studies. Cultivated strains e.g. E. coli K welladapted laboratory environment, and, unlike wildtype strains, lost ability thrive intestine. Many laboratory strains lose ability form biofilms. These features protect wildtype strains antibodies chemical attacks, require large expenditure energy material resources. E. coli often used representative microorganism research novel water treatment sterilisation methods, including photocatalysis. By standard plate count methods, following sequential dilutions, growth agar gel plates, concentration viable organisms CFUs Colony Forming Units, known volume treated water evaluated, allowing comparative assessment materials performance. In , Joshua Lederberg Edward Tatum first described phenomenon known bacterial conjugation using E. coli model bacterium, remains primary model study conjugation. E. coli integral part first experiments understand phage genetics, early researchers, Seymour Benzer, used E. coli phage T understand topography gene structure. Prior Benzer's research, known whether gene linear structure, branching pattern. E. coli one first organisms genome sequenced; complete genome E. coli K published Science From , team Hungarian Academy Science created strain Escherichia coli called MDS, sold Scarab Genomics Madison, WI name "Clean Genome E. coli", genome parental strain E. coli K MG removed aid molecular biology efficiency, removing IS elements, pseudogenes phages, resulting better maintenance plasmidencoded toxic genes, often inactivated transposons. Biochemistry replication machinery altered. By evaluating possible combination nanotechnologies landscape ecology, complex habitat landscapes generated details nanoscale. On synthetic ecosystems, evolutionary experiments E. coli performed study spatial biophysics adaptation island biogeography onchip. In studies, nonpathogenic E. coli used model microorganism towards understanding effects simulated microgravity Earth same. Since , scientists proposed idea genetic circuits used computational tasks. Collaboration biologists computing scientists allowed designing digital logic gates metabolism E. coli. As Lac operon twostage process, genetic regulation bacteria used realize computing functions. The process controlled transcription stage DNA messenger RNA. Studies performed attempting program E. coli solve complicated mathematics problems, Hamiltonian path problem. A computer control protein production E. coli within yeast cells developed. A method also developed use bacteria behave LCD screen. In July , separate experiments E. coli published Nature showed potential using living cells computing tasks storing information. A team formed collaborators Biodesign Institute Arizona State University Harvards Wyss Institute Biologically Inspired Engineering developed biological computer inside E. coli responded dozen inputs. The team called computer "ribocomputer", composed ribonucleic acid. Meanwhile, Harvard researchers probed possible store information bacteria successfully archiving images movies DNA living E. coli cells. In , team led biophysicist Sangram Bagh realized study E. coli solve x maze problems probe principle distributed computing among cells. In , GermanAustrian pediatrician Theodor Escherich discovered organism feces healthy individuals. He called Bacterium coli commune found colon. Early classifications prokaryotes placed handful genera based shape motility time Ernst Haeckel's classification bacteria kingdom Monera place. Bacterium coli type species invalid genus Bacterium revealed former type species "Bacterium triloculare" missing. Following revision Bacterium, reclassified Bacillus coli Migula later reclassified newly created genus Escherichia, named original discoverer. In , world's worst date outbreak E. coli food poisoning occurred Wishaw, Scotland, killing people. This death toll exceeded , Germany E. coli O:H outbreak, linked organic fenugreek sprouts, killed people. E. coli several practical uses besides use vector genetic experiments processes.
