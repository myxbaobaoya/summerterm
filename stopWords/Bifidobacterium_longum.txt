Bifidobacterium longum Grampositive, catalasenegative, rodshaped bacterium present human gastrointestinal tract one species belong genus Bifidobacterium. It microaerotolerant anaerobe considered one earliest colonizers gastrointestinal tract infants. When grown general anaerobic medium, B. longum forms white, glossy colonies convex shape. While B. longum significantly present adult gastrointestinal tract, considered part gut microbiota production lactic acid believed prevent growth pathogenic organisms. B. longum nonpathogenic often added food products. In , three previously distinct species Bifidobacterium, B. infantis, B. longum, B. suis, unified single species named B. longum biotypes infantis, longum, suis, respectively. This occurred three species extensive DNA similarity including rRNA gene sequence similarity greater . In addition, three original species phenotypically difficult distinguish due different carbohydrate fermentation patterns among strains species. As probiotic activity varies among strains B. longum, interest exists exact classification new strains, although made difficult high gene similarity three biotypes. Currently, strain identification done polymerase chain reaction PCR subtly different rRNA gene sequences. B. longum colonizes human gastrointestinal tract, it, along Bifidobacterium species, represents bacteria infant's gastrointestinal tract. This number gradually drops adult's gastrointestinal tract enteric bacteria Bacteroides Eubacterium begin dominate. Some strains B. longum found high tolerance gastric acid bile, suggesting strains would able survive gastrointestinal tract colonize lower small large intestines. The persistence B. longum gut attributed glycoproteinbinding fimbriae structures bacterial polysaccharides, latter possess strong electrostatic charges aid adhesion B. longum intestinal endothelial cells. This adhesion also enhanced fatty acids lipoteichoic acid B. longum cell wall. B. longum considered scavenger, possessing multiple catabolic pathways use large variety nutrients increase competitiveness among gut microbiota. Up types permease exist transport various carbohydrates ATPbinding cassette transporters. B. longum several glycosyl hydrolases metabolise complex oligosaccharides carbon energy. This necessary mono disaccharides usually consumed time reach lower gastrointestinal tract B. longum resides. In addition, B. longum uniquely ferment galactomannanrich natural gum using glucosaminidases alphamannosidases participate fermentation glucosamine mannose, respectively. The high number genes associated oligosaccharide metabolism result gene duplication horizontal gene transfer, indicating B. longum selective pressure increase capability compete various substrates gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, B. longum possesses hydrolases, deaminases, dehydratases ferment amino acids. B. longum also bile salt hydrolases hydrolyze bile salts amino acids bile acids. The function clear, although B. longum could use amino acids products better tolerate bile salts. A number cases B. longum infection reported scientific literature. These primarily cases preterm infants undergoing probiotic treatment, although also reports infection adults. Infection preterm infants manifests bacteremia necrotizing enterocolitis, adults reports sepsis peritonitis. B. longum constituent VSL. This proprietary, standardized, formulation live bacteria may used combination conventional therapies treat ulcerative colitis, requires prescription. The use B. longum shown shorten duration minimize severity symptoms associated common cold similar effect neuraminidase inhibitors influenza. Bifidobacterium longum ssp. longum , previously classified Bifidobacterium longum ssp. infantis , classified Bifidobacterium infantis still marketed such. It sold brand name Align US Canada Alflorex Ireland, UK European countries. It patented. This strain isolated directly epithelium terminal ileum healthy human subject, one researched probiotic strains. Large scale clinical trials shown strain effective controlling symptoms IBS including bloating, diarrhoea, abdominal pain discomfort
