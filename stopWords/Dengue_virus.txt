Some epitopes partially totally inaccessible known structure mature virion The corresponding antibodies therefore assumed bind alternate transitional conformations virus °Ccitation needed Common names dengue fever include breakbone fever vomiting dandy fever dengue hemorrhagic fever dengue shock syndrome severe forms Dengue found tropical subtropical climates worldwide mostly urban semiurban areas People ages exposed infected mosquitoes possible victims dengue fever The disease occurs often rainy season tropical countries Southeast Asia South Asia South America high numbers infected mosquitoes The virus transmitted humans bites infected female mosquitoes though humans capable transmitting disease contagious The incubation period days period illness – days Signs symptoms may include severe

tourniquet test result A recent systematic review metaanalysis showed allergic symptoms one core symptoms highly associated dengue severity Some people suffer severe forms dengue dengue hemorrhagic fever Different strains viruses interacting people different immune backgrounds lead complex interaction Among possible causes crossserotypic immune response mechanism known antibodydependent enhancement happens person previously infected dengue gets infected second third fourth time The previous antibodies old strain dengue virus interfere immune response current strain leading paradoxically virus entry uptake In recent years many studies shown flaviviruses especially dengue virus ability inhibit innate immune response infection Indeed dengue virus many nonstructural proteins allow inhibition various mediators innate immune system response These proteins act two levels NSB small hydrophobic protein located association endoplasmic reticulum It may block

transmitted mosquito species Aedes aegypti produces saliva contains unique proteins including protein family D Scientists used believe A aegypti saliva transmitted actually enhanced dengue virus body The mosquitos saliva thought make virus spread faster due weakened immune response host However current study found protein D hinders virus transmission host cells The immune responses antibodies trying fight foreign virus actually increase transmission make infection worse Levels protein D prevalent salivary glands dengueinfected mosquitoes compared uninfected ones D found mosquito saliva thought assist process blood feeding Despite prior assumptions D modulate host cell act virus prevent viral infection Unfortunately D proteins provoke immune responses raise antiD antibody levels These antibodies inhibit function D proteins enhance transmission dengue viruscitation needed Although immune responses D proteins might impair antiviral activity study showed nonDENV subjects slightly higher antiD IgG levels infected ones although statistically significant Thus studies D protein family needed elucidate role DENV infection applicability medicine Only one vaccine dengue currently approved countries Mexico Philippines Indonesia Brazil El Salvador Costa Rica Paraguay Guatemala Peru Thailand Singapore Several vaccines development private public researchers Developing vaccine disease challenging With four different serotypes virus cause disease vaccine must immunize four types effective Vaccination one serotype could possibly lead severe dengue hemorrhagic shock infected another serotype due antibodydependent enhancement When infected dengue virus immune system produces crossreactive antibodies provide immunity particular serotype However antibodies incapable neutralizing serotypes upon reinfection actually increase viral replication When macrophages consume neutralized virus virus able replicate within macrophage causing disease These crossreactive ineffective antibodies ease access virus macrophages induces severe disease dengue hemorrhagic fever dengue shock syndrome A common problem faced dengueendemic regions mothers become infected dengue giving birth offspring carry immunity mother susceptible hemorrhagic fever infected three serotypes One vaccine phase III trials planning vaccine usage effectiveness surveillance started In
