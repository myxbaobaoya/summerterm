Vaccinia virus VACV VV large complex enveloped virus belonging poxvirus family It linear doublestranded DNA genome approximately kbp length encodes approximately genes The dimensions virion roughly × × nm mass approximately – fg The vaccinia virus source modern smallpox vaccine World Health Organisation used eradicate smallpox global vaccination campaign – Although smallpox longer exists wild vaccinia virus still studied widely scientists tool gene therapy genetic engineering Smallpox endemic human disease fatality rate In British doctor Edward Jenner proved infection relatively mild cowpox virus would also confer immunity deadly smallpox Jenner referred cowpox variolae vaccinae smallpox cow However origins smallpox vaccine became murky time especially Louis Pasteur developed laboratory techniques creating vaccines th century Allan Watt Downie demonstrated modern smallpox vaccine serologically distinct cowpox vaccinia subsequently recognized separate viral species Wholegenome sequencing revealed vaccinia closely related horsepox cowpox strains found Great Britain least closely related vaccinia In addition morbidity uncomplicated primary vaccination transfer infection sites scratching postvaccinial encephalitis complications vaccinia infections may divided following types Vaccinia virus closely related virus causes cowpox historically two often considered one The precise origin vaccinia virus unknown due lack recordkeeping virus repeatedly cultivated passaged research laboratories many decades The common notion vaccinia virus cowpox virus variola virus causative agent smallpox derived common ancestral virus There also speculation vaccinia virus originally isolated horses analysis DNA early sample smallpox vaccine showed similar horsepox virus Poxviruses unique among DNA viruses replicate cytoplasm host cell outside nucleus Therefore large genome required encoding various enzymes proteins involved viral DNA replication gene transcription During replication cycle VV produces four infectious forms differ outer membranes intracellular mature virion IMV intracellular enveloped virion IEV cellassociated enveloped virion CEV extracellular enveloped virion EEV Although issue remains contentious prevailing view IMV consists single lipoprotein membrane CEV EEV surrounded two membrane layers IEV three envelopes The IMV abundant infectious form thought responsible spread hosts On hand CEV believed play role celltocell spread EEV thought important long range dissemination within host organismcitation needed Vaccinia virus able undergo multiplicity reactivation MR MR process two virus genomes containing otherwise lethal damage interact within infected cell form viable virus genome Abel found vaccinia viruses exposed doses UV light sufficient prevent progeny formation single virus particles infected host chick embryo cells could still produce viable progeny viruses host cells infected two inactivated viruses MR could occur Kim Sharp demonstrated MR vaccinia virus treatment UVlight nitrogen mustard Xrays gamma rays Michod et al reviewed numerous examples MR different viruses suggested MR common form sexual interaction viruses provides advantage recombinational repair genome damagesadditional citations needed Vaccinia contains within genome genes several proteins give virus resistance interferons Vaccinia virus infection typically mild often cause symptoms healthy individuals although may cause rash fever Immune responses generated vaccinia virus infection protects person lethal smallpox infection For reason vaccinia virus still used livevirus vaccine smallpox Unlike vaccines use weakened forms virus vaccinated vaccinia virus vaccine cannot cause smallpox infection contain smallpox virus However certain complications andor vaccine adverse effects occasionally arise The chance happening significantly increased people immunocompromised Approximately people every million people vaccinated could die result lifethreatening reactions vaccination Currentlywhen vaccine administered health care workers research personnel high risk contracting variola virus military personnel United States Due threat smallpox bioterrorism possibility vaccine may widely administered future Therefore scientists currentlywhen developing novel vaccine strategies smallpox safer much faster deploy bioterrorism event On September US Food Drug Administration FDA licensed new vaccine ACAM smallpox produced quickly upon need Manufactured Sanofi Pasteur US Centers Disease Control Prevention stockpiled million doses new vaccine see list common strains A new smallpox vaccine Imvanex based modified strain vaccinia Modified vaccinia Ankara approved European Medicines Agency Vaccinia also used recombinant vaccines vector expression foreign genes within host order generate immune response Other poxviruses also used live recombinant vaccines The original vaccine smallpox origin idea vaccination Cowpox described Edward Jenner The Latin term used Cowpox Variolae vaccinae Jenners translation "smallpox cow" That term lent name whole idea vaccination When realized virus used smallpox vaccination longer cowpox virus name vaccinia used virus smallpox vaccine See OED Vaccine potency efficacy prior invention refrigerated methods transportation unreliable The vaccine would rendered impotent heat sunlight method drying samples quills shipping countries need often resulted inactive vaccine Another method employed "arm arm" method This involved vaccinating individual transferring another soon infectious pustule forms another etc This method used form living transportation vaccine usually employed orphans carriers However method problematic due possibility spreading blood diseases hepatitis syphilis case Italian children contracted syphilis vaccinated "arm arm" method Henry Austin Martin introduced method vaccine production calves In E Steinhardt C Israeli R A Lambert grew vaccinia virus fragments pig corneal tissue culture A paper published Fredrick W Twort student Willian Bulloch considered beginning modern phage research He attempting grow vaccinia virus agar media absence living cells noted many colonies contaminating micrococci grew appeared mucoid watery glassy transformation could induced colonies inoculation fresh colony material watery colony Using microscope observed bacteria degenerated small granules stained red Giemsa stain He concluded "it agent transformation might almost considered acute infectious disease micrococci" In Allan Watt Downie showed smallpox vaccines used th century cowpox virus immunologically related In March yearold Indiana boy mother contracted lifethreatening vaccinia infection boys father The boy developed telltale rash percent body coming close contact father vaccinated smallpox deployed overseas United States Army The United States military resumed smallpox vaccinations The child acquired infection due eczema known risk factor vaccinia infection The boy treated intravenous immunoglobulin cidofovir Tecovirimat ST experimental drug developed SIGA Technologies On April sent home effects except possible scarring skin In Centers Disease Control Prevention CDC reported woman Washington contracted vaccinia virus infection digital vaginal contact boyfriend military member recently vaccinated smallpox The woman history childhood eczema symptomatic adult The CDC indicated aware four similar cases preceding months vaccinia infection sexual contact recent military vaccinee Further casesalso patients history eczemaoccurred This list wellcharacterized vaccinia strains used research vaccinationcitation needed
