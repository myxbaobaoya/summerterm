Molluscum contagiosum virus MCV DNA poxvirus causes human skin infection molluscum contagiosum Molluscum contagiosum affects people year diagnosed skin diseases Diagnosis based size shape skin lesions confirmed biopsy virus cannot routinely cultured Molluscum contagiosum virus species genus Molluscipoxvirus MCV member subfamily Chordopoxvirinae family Poxviridae Other commonly known viruses reside subfamily Chordopoxvirinae variola virus cause smallpox monkeypox virus The poxvirus family uniquely contains nonenveloped particles mature virions enveloped particles extracellular virions The structure virions consistent others poxvirus family composed nucleocapsid core envelope lateral body extracellular envelope Like poxviruses MCV DNA virus replicates cytoplasm instead nucleus Because virus must bring necessary enzymes replication encode enzymes genome The Molluscum contagiosum virus virion described ovalshaped dimension approximately nm × nm × nm The virus two distinct infectious particles called mature virion MV enveloped virion EV differ EV contains second outer cellular membrane Poxviridae virus family contains enveloped nonenveloped infectious particles Other structures EV MV virion include nucleocapsid core wall two lateral bodies Before virion released cytosol lateral bodies associated virion core boding interactions However virion release cytoplasm virion core wall expands forces lateral bodies dissociate The lateral bodies function transport one vital virion proteins needed genome replication expression The genome consists linear double stranded DNA molecule approximately kilobases length The genome unique two ends double stranded DNA sequence inverted repeats This inverted terminal sequence kilobases length vary kilobases among poxviruses There genes encoded Molluscum contagiosum virus Over genes conserved viruses poxvirus family Variola virus Vaccinia virus The inverted terminal sequence MCV differs sequences others poxvirus family contains genusspecific host response evasion genes The genome contains GC bases thus encodes lesser amount stop codons UAA UGA UAG compared poxviruses Further gene analysis shown MCV genome contains many long overlapping open reading frames Molluscum contagiosum virus similar poxviruses produces two infectious particles mature virions MV extracellular virions EV EV differing MV possess extra cellular membrane To enter cell membrane MV fuses plasma membrane specifically glycosaminoglycans host cell enters via macropinocytosis This process initiated presence phosphatidylserine molecules exposed MV cellular membrane Similarly outer membrane EV fuses plasma membrane specifically glycosaminoglycans host cell also enters via macropinocytosis After macropinocytosis H pumped inside internalized vacuole containing EV acidification breaks outer membrane exposing MV like particle For MV EV cellular membranes fuse vacuole allowing release virus core cytosol The virion uncoated exposing DNA commence replication Molluscum contagiosum virus like poxviruses replicates entirely cytoplasm host cell This property unique poxviruses DNA viruses replicate nucleus Therefore host cell proteins DNA replication present inside nucleus virus bring encode proteins needed replication Each virion sets region cytoplasm called viral factory DNA replication transcription translation occur sequentially There three phases DNA transcription During early phase genes encode transcription factors viral DNA RNA polymerases proteins stimulate host cell mitosis transcribed DNA dependent RNA polymerase virion carries The mRNA produced early phase translated viral transcriptase virion also carries Then intermediate phase proteins encoded early phase used replicate viral DNA Additionally transcription factors produced help transcribe late phase mRNA During late phase genes encoding structural proteins enzymes needed future infection transcribed translated Gene expression sequential early intermediate late phase transcription temporally regulated The virion cytoplasmic factories serve place mature virions assembled future infection Mature virions released via cell lysis aid host host transmission virus Extracellular virions made MV acquires second membrane via Golgi apparatus buds cell Extracellular virions aid spreading virus within epithelial tissue Molluscum contagiosum virus infects human epidermal cells It spread throughout body explains virus cannot transmitted coughing sneezing People attempted grow virus cell culture study molecular properties largely unsuccessful due infecting epidermal cells However evidence ability adapt survive different types cells humans severely compromised immune systems Using qPCR analysis determined significant Molluscum contagiosum virus plasma one patient large tcell deficiency The patient given CMX antiviral agent treatment severe molluscum contagiosum symptoms Before administering CMX drug Molluscum contagiosum virus DNA found plasma samples whereas DNA found samples administering drug This first time molluscum contagiosum DNA ever detected blood patient Several proteins produced mRNA intermediate phase transcription modulate host cell processes promote ideal environment viral replication transcription Molecular analysis shown MCV proteins may potentially interfere host cell processes However MCV proteins confirmed host cell functions These proteins include MC MC MC MC MC MC MC The following list give overview proteins modulate host cell processes This viral infection skin usually presents children ages – immunocompromised patients The main symptom disease round hard flesh colored painless bumps sunken centers apparent surface skin Figure The bumps generally less millimeters diameter become red inflamed itchy person rubs They generally found face neck armpits hands However bumps may also found genitals adults disease spread sexual contact The virus spread directly person person skin skin contact fomites inanimate objects contaminated virus The common fomites molluscum contagiosum transmission clothing towels bathing sponges toys sports equipment Additionally virus spread skin areas ones body itching rubbing virus It also spread adults sexual contact The virus circulated throughout body thus cannot spread coughing sneezing The transmission virus prevented washing hands sharing items refraining sexual contact shaving keeping bumps clean covered Generally one functioning immune system treatment needed bumps virus go away within – months contraction However treatment suggested bumps genital area person affected immunocompromised In healthy nonimmunocompromised individuals cryotherapy curettage laser therapy oral therapy topical therapy suggested treat lesions Cryotherapy involves freezing lesions liquid nitrogen whereas curettage involves piercing core scraping lesion sterile equipment Laser therapy involves destroying lesion laser It good idea try removing lesions skin become infected virus spread parts body A commonly prescribed oral medication used treat lesions cimetidine topical therapy Podophyllotoxin cream People severely weakened immune systems molluscum contagiosum may bumps lesions greater millimeters look different normal Most typical therapies ineffective treating people The recommended treatment case therapies help boost immune system
