Oxalobacter formigenes Gram negative oxalatedegrading anaerobic bacterium first isolated gastrointestinal tract sheep . To date, bacterium found colonizes large intestines numerous vertebrates, including humans, even isolated freshwater sediment. It processes oxalate decarboxylation formate oxalylCoA decarboxylase, producing energy process. The broadspectrum quinolone antibiotics kill O. formigenes.citation needed If person's gastrointestinal GI tract lacks bacterium, therefore lacks primary source oxalylCoA decarboxylase enzyme, GI tract cannot degrade dietary oxalates digestion get absorbed easily vitamin Bmodulated partial metabolic degradation body, excreted kidney, precipitates calcium form calcium oxalate kidney stones. Oxalobacter formigenes protect kidney stones degrading oxalate. The role presence O. formigenes human gut area active research. This Betaproteobacteriarelated article stub.
