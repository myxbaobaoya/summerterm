See text. Bifidobacterium genus grampositive, nonmotile, often branched anaerobic bacteria. They ubiquitous inhabitants gastrointestinal tract though strains isolated vagina mouth B. dentium mammals, including humans. Bifidobacteria one major genera bacteria make gastrointestinal tract microbiota mammals. Some bifidobacteria used probiotics. Before s, Bifidobacterium species collectively referred "Lactobacillus bifidus". In , Henri Tissier, French pediatrician Pasteur Institute Paris, isolated bacterium characterised Yshaped morphology "bifid" intestinal microbiota breastfed infants named "bifidus". In , Ã‰lie Metchnikoff, deputy director Pasteur Institute, propounded theory lactic acid bacteria beneficial human health. Metchnikoff observed longevity Bulgarians result consumption fermented milk products. Metchnikoff also suggested "oral administration cultures fermentative bacteria would implant beneficial bacteria intestinal tract". The genus Bifidobacterium possesses unique fructosephosphate phosphoketolase pathway employed ferment carbohydrates.citation needed Much metabolic research bifidobacteria focused oligosaccharide metabolism, carbohydrates available otherwise nutrientlimited habitats. Infantassociated bifidobacterial phylotypes appear evolved ability ferment milk oligosaccharides, whereas adultassociated species use plant oligosaccharides, consistent encounter respective environments. As breastfed infants often harbor bifidobacteriadominated gut consortia, numerous applications attempt mimic bifidogenic properties milk oligosaccharides. These broadly classified plantderived fructooligosaccharides dairyderived galactooligosaccharides, differentially metabolized distinct milk oligosaccharide catabolism. The sensitivity members genus Bifidobacterium O generally limits probiotic activity anaerobic habitats. Recent research reported Bifidobacterium strains exhibit various types oxic growth. Low concentrations O CO stimulatory effect growth Bifidobacterium strains. Based growth profiles different O concentrations, Bifidobacterium species classified four classes: Ohypersensitive, Osensitive, Otolerant, microaerophilic. The primary factor responsible aerobic growth inhibition proposed production hydrogen peroxide HO growth medium. A HOforming NADH oxidase purified Osensitive Bifidobacterium bifidum identified btype dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The kinetic parameters suggested enzyme could involved HO production highly aerated environments. Members genus Bifidobacterium genome sizes ranging . Bifidobacterium indicum . Mb Bifidobacterium biavatii, corresponding , , predicted proteinencoding open reading frames, respectively. Functional classification Bifidobacterium genes, including pangenome genus, revealed . identified bifidobacterial genes encode enzymes involved carbohydrate metabolism. Adding Bifidobacterium probiotic conventional treatment ulcerative colitis shown associated improved rates remission improved maintenance remission. Some Bifidobacterium strains considered important probiotics used food industry. Different species andor strains bifidobacteria may exert range beneficial health effects, including regulation intestinal microbial homeostasis, inhibition pathogens harmful bacteria colonize andor infect gut mucosa, modulation local systemic immune responses, repression procarcinogenic enzymatic activities within microbiota, production vitamins, bioconversion number dietary compounds bioactive molecules. Bifidobacteria improve gut mucosal barrier lower levels lipopolysaccharide intestine. Bifidobacteria may also improve abdominal pain patients irritable bowel syndrome IBS though studies date inconclusive. Naturally occurring Bifidobacterium spp. may discourage growth Gramnegative pathogens infants. Mother's milk contains high concentrations lactose lower quantities phosphate pH buffer. Therefore, mother's milk fermented lactic acid bacteria including bifidobacteria infant's gastrointestinal tract, pH may reduced, making difficult Gramnegative bacteria grow.citation needed The human infant gut relatively sterile birth, takes bacteria surrounding environment mother. The microbiota makes infant gut differs adult gut. An infant reaches adult stage microbiome around years age, microbiome diversity increases, stabilizes, infant switches solid foods. Breastfed infants colonized earlier Bifidobacterium compared babies primarily formulafed. Bifidobacterium common bacteria infant gut microbiome. There variability genotypes time infants, making less stable compared adult Bifidobacterium. Infants children years old show low diversity microbiome bacteria, diversity individuals compared adults. Reduction Bifidobacterium increase diversity infant gut microbiome occurs less breastmilk intake increase solid food intake. Mammalian milk contain oligosaccharides showing natural selectionclarification needed. Human milk oligosaccharides digested enzymes remain whole digestive tract broken colon microbiota. Bifidobacterium species genomes B. longum, B. bifidum, B. breve contain genes hydrolyze human milk oligosaccharides found higher numbers infants breastfed. Glycans produced humans converted food energy B. bifidum. showing example coevolution. The genus Bifidobacterium comprises following species:
