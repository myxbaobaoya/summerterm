Smallpox infectious disease caused one two virus variants Variola major Variola minor The agent variola virus VARV belongs genus Orthopoxvirus The last naturally occurring case diagnosed October World Health Organization WHO certified global eradication disease making human disease eradicated The initial symptoms disease included fever vomiting This followed formation ulcers mouth skin rash Over number days skin rash turned characteristic fluidfilled blisters dent center The bumps scabbed fell leaving scars The disease spread people via contaminated objects Prevention achieved mainly smallpox vaccine Once disease developed certain antiviral medication may helped The risk death higher rates among babies Often survived extensive scarring skin left blind The origin smallpox unknown however earliest evidence disease dates rd century BCE Egyptian mummies The disease historically occurred outbreaks In thcentury Europe estimated people died disease per year onethird cases blindness due smallpox Smallpox estimated killed million people th century around million people last years existence Earlier deaths included six European monarchs As recently million cases occurred year Inoculation smallpox appears started China around Europe adopted practice Asia first half th century In Edward Jenner introduced modern smallpox vaccine In WHO intensified efforts eliminate disease Smallpox one two infectious diseases eradicated rinderpest The term "smallpox" first used Britain early th century distinguish disease syphilis known "great pox" Other historical names disease include pox speckled monster red plague There two forms smallpox virus Variola major severe common form extensive rash higher fever Variola minor less common presentation causing less severe disease typically discrete smallpox historical death rates less Subclinical asymptomatic infections Variola virus noted common In addition form called variola sine eruptione smallpox without rash seen generally vaccinated persons This form marked fever occurred usual incubation period could confirmed antibody studies rarely viral culture In addition two rare fulminating types smallpox malignant flat hemorrhagic forms usually fatal The initial symptoms similar viral diseases still extant influenza common cold fever least °C °F muscle pain malaise headache fatigue As digestive tract commonly involved nausea vomiting backache often occurred The early prodromal stage usually lasted – days By days – first visible lesions – small reddish spots called enanthem – appeared mucous membranes mouth tongue palate throat temperature fell nearnormal These lesions rapidly enlarged ruptured releasing large amounts virus saliva Smallpox virus tended attack skin cells causing characteristic pimples macules associated disease A rash developed skin hours lesions mucous membranes appeared Typically macules first appeared forehead rapidly spread whole face proximal portions extremities trunk lastly distal portions extremities The process took hours new lesions appeared At point variola major infection could take several different courses resulted four types smallpox disease based Rao classification ordinary modified malignant flat hemorrhagic smallpox Historically ordinary smallpox overall fatality rate malignant hemorrhagic forms usually fatal The modified form almost never fatal In early hemorrhagic cases hemorrhages occurred skin lesions developed The incubation period contraction first obvious symptoms disease around days Ninety percent smallpox cases among unvaccinated persons ordinary type In form disease second day rash macules become raised papules By third fourth day papules filled opalescent fluid become vesicles This fluid became opaque turbid within – hours resulting pustules By sixth seventh day skin lesions become pustules Between seven ten days pustules matured reached maximum size The pustules sharply raised typically round tense firm touch The pustules deeply embedded dermis giving feel small bead skin Fluid slowly leaked pustules end second week pustules deflated began dry forming crusts scabs By day – scabs formed lesions started flake leaving depigmented scars Ordinary smallpox generally produced discrete rash pustules stood skin separately The distribution rash dense face denser extremities trunk denser distal parts extremities proximal The palms hands soles feet involved cases Sometimes blisters merged sheets forming confluent rash began detach outer layers skin underlying flesh Patients confluent smallpox often remained ill even scabs formed lesions In one case series casefatality rate confluent smallpox percent Referring character eruption rapidity development modified smallpox occurred mostly previously vaccinated people It rare unvaccinated people one case study showing – modified cases compared around vaccinated people In form prodromal illness still occurred may less severe ordinary type There usually fever evolution rash The skin lesions tended fewer evolved quickly superficial may shown uniform characteristic typical smallpox Modified smallpox rarely ever fatal This form variola major easily confused chickenpox In malignanttype smallpox also called flat smallpox lesions remained almost flush skin time raised vesicles would formed ordinary type It unknown people developed type Historically accounted – percent cases percent children Malignant smallpox accompanied severe prodromal phase lasted – days prolonged high fever severe symptoms viremia The prodromal symptoms continued even onset rash The rash mucous membranes enanthem extensive Skin lesions matured slowly typically confluent semiconfluent seventh eighth day flat appeared buried skin Unlike ordinarytype smallpox vesicles contained little fluid soft velvety touch may contained hemorrhages Malignant smallpox nearly always fatal death usually occurred th th day illness Often day two death lesions turned ashen gray along abdominal distension bad prognostic sign This form thought caused deficient cellmediated immunity smallpox If person recovered lesions gradually faded form scars scabs Hemorrhagic smallpox severe form accompanied extensive bleeding skin mucous membranes gastrointestinal tract viscera This form develops approximately two percent infections occurs mostly adults Pustules typically form hemorrhagic smallpox Instead bleeding occurs skin making look charred black hence form disease also referred variola nigra "black pox" Hemorrhagic smallpox rarely caused Variola minor While bleeding may occur mild cases affect outcomes hemorrhagic smallpox typically fatal Vaccination appear provide immunity either form hemorrhagic smallpox cases even occurred among people revaccinated shortly It two forms The early fulminant form hemorrhagic smallpox referred purpura variolosa begins prodromal phase characterized high fever severe headache abdominal pain The skin becomes dusky erythematous rapidly followed development petechiae bleeding skin conjunctiva mucous membranes Death often occurs suddenly fifth seventh days illness insignificant skin lesions present Some people survive days longer time skin detaches fluid accumulates rupturing slightest injury People usually conscious end shortly end Autopsy reveals petechiae bleeding spleen kidney serous membranes skeletal muscles pericardium liver gonads bladder Historically condition frequently misdiagnosed correct diagnosis made autopsy This form likely occur pregnant women general population approximately cases unvaccinated pregnant women early hemorrhagic smallpox versus roughly nonpregnant women adult males The case fatality rate early hemorrhagic smallpox approaches There also later form hemorrhagic smallpox referred late hemorrhagic smallpox variolosa pustula hemorrhagica The prodrome severe similar observed early hemorrhagic smallpox fever persists throughout course disease Bleeding appears early eruptive period later seen purpura variolosa rash often flat progress beyond vesicular stage Hemorrhages mucous membranes appear occur less often early hemorrhagic form Sometimes rash forms pustules bleed base undergo process ordinary smallpox This form disease characterized decrease elements coagulation cascade increase circulating antithrombin This form smallpox occurs anywhere three percent fatal cases
