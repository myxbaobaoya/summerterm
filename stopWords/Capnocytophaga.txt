C. canimorsus C. cynodegmi C. gingivalis C. granulosa C. haemolytica C. leadbetteri C. ochracea C. sputigena Capnocytophaga genus Gramnegative bacteria. Normally found oropharyngeal tract mammals, involved pathogenesis animal bite wounds periodontal diseases. The term Capnocytophaga comes "capno" dependence CO "cytophaga" flexibility mobility shift gliding motility. It belongs family Flavobacteriaceae, order Flavobacteriales. This genus includes eight different species: C. ochracea, C. gingivalis, C. granulosa, C. haemolytica, C. sputigena, C. leadbetteri isolated oral cavity humans, C. canimorsus, C. cynodegmi isolated oral cavity animals. Many strains also described whose classification remains uncertain. Capnocytophaga spp. fusiform Gramnegative bacilli, part oral commensal flora. Microscopic observation revealed high degree polymorphism, variation size appearance depending strain culture conditions. This polymorphism also reflected observation colonies orangepigmented colonies, spreading agar, etc.. Capnocytophaga spp. capnophilic bacteria; live environments concentration carbon dioxide greater atmosphere least CO. They also grow anaerobically. They require enriched media, type blood agar, incubated Â°C. The isolation strains Capnocytophaga polymicrobial samples also possible selective media containing antibiotics. The identification carried various biochemical tests, used identification Gramnegative bacterial species, rapid determination enzymatic reactions. The diagnosis delayed slow difficult growth Capnocytophaga hours. The molecular techniques S rDNA PCR sequencing, mass spectrometry appear attractive methods reliable identification genus. The identification species level remains difficult single method used. Capnocytophaga commensal genus considered opportunistic pathogen. These bacteria involved different types infections, severity depends immune status patient. In literature, cases reported immunocompromised immunocompetent patients. In immunocompetent patients, bacteria belong oral bacterial community responsible periodontal infections affecting destroying supporting tissues teeth periodontal tissue. Capnocytophaga strains often isolated periodontal pockets, also apical periodontal abscesses, association bacterial parodontal species. This condition increase alveolar bone loss, attachment loss, tooth mobility, finally tooth loss. It cause diseases widely reported literature, bacteremia potentially complicated septic shock, infections musculoskeletal system osteomyelitis, arthritis, lung empyema, lung abscess, digestive peritonitis, maternalfetal ovarian abscess, chorioamnionitis, eye conjunctivitis, heart endocartitis brain meningitis. Capnocytophaga clinically important pediatric oncology hematology, especially patients aplasia. C. canimorsus C. cynodegmi commonly transmitted dog bites known cause sepsis, potentially complicated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura hemolytic uremic syndrome, immunocompromised patients Capnocytophaga spp. usually susceptible antibiotics, emergence betalactamresistant strains observed early . Genes antibiotic resistance gradually spread among pathogenic bacterial species horizontal gene transfer. Susceptibility various betalactam antibiotics described variable depending strain Capnocytophaga. This resistance often linked production beta lactamases. Most betalactamases identified Bacteroides, Prevotella, Capnocytophaga belong Ambler class A. Several betalactamases encoded chromosome plasmid associated mobile genetic elements described Capnocytophaga spp. The common are: CfxA, CfxA, CepA, CblA, andor CSP. Capnocytophaga spp. resistant thirdgeneration cephalosporins, remain susceptible imipenem, cefoxitin, amoxicillin combined clavulanic acid. Although resistant strains frequently isolated oral cavities, prevalence worrying, JolivetGougeon et al., ; Sixou et al., . The CfxA broad spectrum beta lactamases CfxA, CfxA CfxA belong group e Bush classification. This class includes betalactamase enzymes significant activity cephalosporins monobactams, rather penicillins. Following characterization CfxA beta lactamase B. vulgatus CfxA betalactamase P. intermedia nucleotide Genbank accession number AF, new group e Bush classification named CfxA nucleotide GenBank accession number AF characterized C. ochracea E JolivetGougeon et al. . The cfxA gene identity cfxA B. vulgatus cfxA P. intermedia. The analysis bp nucleotide sequence showed gene encoding betalactamase CfxA C. ochracea E differs cfxA gene B. vulgatus substitution two amino acids KE YD cfxA gene P. intermedia substitution one amino acid YD. CfxA different CfxA aspartic acid place tyrosine position CfxA glutamic acid instead lysine position . In , Handal et al. b identified novel Ambler class A betalactamase called CSP NOR C. sputigena strain, resistant amoxicillin first second generation cephalosporins. The new beta lactamase homology CfxA, CblA CepA. CSP encoded blaCSP gene GenBank nucleotide sequence accession number GQ. The GC content gene, genetic environment, lack conjugal transfer detection two reference strains suggest intrinsic resistance gene located chromosome. CepA Chromosomal cephalosporinase Bacteroides fragilis belonging Ambler class A endogenous cephalosporinase A described Bacteroides fragilis. This beta lactamase ubiquitous, frequently inactive. CepA encoded cepA gene, frequently vertically transferred Boente et al. . CblA Chromosomal betalactamase Bacteroides uniformis belonging Ambler class A specific endogenous cephalosporinase described B. uniformis, susceptible clavulanic acid. The homology protein sequences CepA CblA nucleotide sequences. A comparison protein sequence alignment cepA beta lactamases reveals conservation least four common elements Ambler class A. According studies, different sensitivities reported macrolides, rifampin, quinolones, metronidazole, vancomycin, aminoglycosides, mechanism involved precisely described. The high frequency strains producing betalactamase limit use single betalactam antibiotics firstline treatment, underlies need test vitro susceptibility clinical isolates. Many antimicrobial treatments used despite lack randomized trials guidelines relating duration treatment according infected sites. The imipenemcilastatin, clindamycin, combinations containing inhibitor betalactamases i.e. Augmentin, Unasyn always effective use recommended. For Capnocytophaga canimorsus, drug choice penicillin G, given without betalactamase inhibitor depending resistance.
