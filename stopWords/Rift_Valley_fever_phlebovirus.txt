Rift Valley fever RVF viral disease humans livestock cause mild severe symptoms The mild symptoms may include fever muscle pains headaches often last week The severe symptoms may include loss sight beginning three weeks infection infections brain causing severe headaches confusion bleeding together liver problems may occur within first days Those bleeding chance death high The disease caused RVF virus It spread either touching infected animal blood breathing air around infected animal butchered drinking raw milk infected animal bite infected mosquitoes Animals cows sheep goats camels may affected In animals spread mostly mosquitoes It appear one person infect another person The disease diagnosed finding antibodies virus virus blood Prevention disease humans accomplished vaccinating animals disease This must done outbreak occurs done outbreak may worsen situation Stopping movement animals outbreak may also useful may decreasing mosquito numbers avoiding bites There human vaccine however widely available There specific treatment medical efforts supportive Outbreaks disease occurred Africa Arabia Outbreaks usually occur periods increased rain increase number mosquitoes The disease first reported among livestock Rift Valley Kenya early virus first isolated In humans virus cause several syndromes Usually sufferers either symptoms mild illness fever headache muscle pains liver abnormalities In small percentage cases illness progress hemorrhagic fever syndrome meningoencephalitis inflammation brain tissues lining brain affect eye Patients become ill usually experience fever generalised weakness back pain dizziness weight loss onset illness Typically people recover within two seven days onset About people disease die In livestock fatality level significantly higher Pregnant livestock infected RVF abort virtually foetuses An epizootic animal disease epidemic RVF usually first indicated wave unexplained abortionscitation needed Other signs livestock include vomiting diarrhoea respiratory disease fever lethargy anorexia sudden death young animals The virus belongs Bunyavirales order This order enveloped negative single stranded RNA viruses All Bunyaviruses outer lipid envelope two glycoproteinsGN GCrequired cell entry They deliver genome hostcell cytoplasm fusing envelope endosomal membranecitation needed The virus GC protein class II membrane fusion protein architecture similar found flaviviruses alphaviruses This structural similarity suggests may common origin viral familiescitation needed The virus kb tripartite genome composed singlestranded RNA As Phlebovirus ambisense genome Its L M segments negativesense S segment ambisense These three genome segments code six major proteins L protein viral polymerase two glycoproteins GN GC nucleocapsid N protein nonstructural NSs NSm proteinscitation needed The virus transmitted mosquito vectors well contact tissue infected animals Two speciesCulex tritaeniorhynchus Aedes vexansare known transmit virus Other potential vectors include Aedes caspius Aedes mcintosh Aedes ochraceus Culex pipiens Culex antennatus Culex perexiguus Culex zombaensis Culex quinquefasciatus Contact infected tissue considered main source human infections The virus isolated two bat species Peters epauletted fruit bat Micropteropus pusillus aba roundleaf bat Hipposideros abae believed reservoirs virus Although many components RVFVs RNA play important role virus pathology nonstructural protein encoded S segment NSs component found directly affect host NSs hostile combative hosts interferon IFNs antiviral response IFNs essential order immune system fight viral infections host This inhibitory mechanism believed due number reasons first competitive inhibition formation transcription factor On transcription factor NSs interacts binds subunit needed RNA polymerase I II This interaction cause competitive inhibition another transcription factor component prevents assembly process transcription factor complex results suppression host antiviral response Transcription suppression believed another mechanism inhibitory process This occurs area NSs interacts binds hosts protein SAP forms complex This complex causes histone acetylation regress needed transcriptional activation IFN promoter This causes IFN expression obstructed Lastly NSs also known affect regular activity doublestranded RNAdependent protein kinase R This protein involved cellular antiviral responses host When RVFV able enter hosts DNA NSs forms filamentous structure nucleus This allows virus interact specific areas hosts DNA relates segregation defects induction chromosome continuity This increases host infectivity decreases hosts antiviral response Diagnosis relies viral isolation tissues serological testing ELISA Other methods diagnosis include Nucleic Acid Testing NAT cell culture IgM antibody assays As September Kenya Medical Research Institute KEMRI developed product called Immunoline designed diagnose disease humans much faster previous methods A persons chances becoming infected reduced taking measures decrease contact blood body fluids tissues infected animals protection mosquitoes bloodsucking insects Use mosquito repellents bed nets two effective methods For persons working animals RVFendemic areas wearing protective equipment avoid exposure blood tissues animals may potentially infected important protective measure Potentially establishing environmental monitoring case surveillance systems may aid prediction control future RVF outbreaks No vaccines currently available humans While vaccines developed humans used experimentally scientific personnel highrisk environments Trials number vaccines NDBR TSIGSD ongoing Different types vaccines veterinary use available The killed vaccines practical routine animal field vaccination need multiple injections Live vaccines require single injection known cause birth defects abortions sheep induce lowlevel protection cattle The liveattenuated vaccine MP demonstrated promising results laboratory trials domesticated animals research needed vaccine used field The liveattenuated clone vaccine recently registered used South Africa Alternative vaccines using molecular recombinant constructs development show promising results A vaccine conditionally approved use animals US It shown knockout NSs NSm nonstructural proteins virus produces effective vaccine sheep well RVF outbreaks occur across subSaharan Africa outbreaks occurring elsewhere infrequently Outbreaks disease usually correspond warm phases EI NiñoSouthern Oscillation During time increase rainfall flooding greenness vegetation index leads increase mosquito vectors RVFV transmitted vertically mosquitos meaning virus passed mother offspring During dry conditions virus remain viable number years egg Mosquitos lay eggs water eventually hatch As water essential mosquito eggs hatch rainfall flooding cause increase mosquito population increased potential virus The first documented outbreak identified Kenya sheep cattle humans another severe outbreak country – involved deaths livestock unrecorded number humans fever An outbreak occurred South Africa – infected animals first deaths humans In Egypt – estimated people infected least deaths In Kenya virus killed peoplecitation needed Since outbreaks Saudi Arabia Yemen
