G. asaccharolytic G. bergeri G. cuniculi G. haemolysans G. morbillorum G. palaticanis G. parahaemolysans G. sanguinis G. taiwanensis Gemella genus Grampositive bacteria thrive best high partial pressure CO. A Gemella species first described Neisseria hemolysans . It reclassified new genus strains found distinct enough Neisseria require new genus. The name suggested based organism diplococcus gemellus diminutive geminus, Latin twin. They facultatively anaerobic give negative reactions oxidase catalase tests. They obligately fermentative, producing either mixture acetic lactic acids equimolar molar mixture acetic acid CO. For example, G. haemolysans ferments glucose forming mixture acetic lactic acids absence oxygen, whereas oxygen present, forms acetic acid CO. Gemella bacteria primarily found mucous membranes humans animals, particularly oral cavity upper digestive tract. Gemella haemolysans found involved pulmonary exacerbations cystic fibrosis patients. As year reported cases human endocarditis, mainly men underlying valvular disease andor poor dentition dental manipulation. Most cases treated combination penicillin gentamicin favorable outcome. Additionally, Gemella asaccharolytica bacterial vaginosis associated increase risk HIV infection unprotected sex. This Bacillotarelated article stub. You help Wikipedia expanding it.
