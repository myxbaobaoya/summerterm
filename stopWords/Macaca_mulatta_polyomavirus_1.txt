SV abbreviation simian vacuolating virus simian virus polyomavirus found monkeys humans Like polyomaviruses SV DNA virus potential cause tumors animals often persists latent infection SV widely studied model eukaryotic virus leading many early discoveries eukaryotic DNA replication transcription The hypothesis SV might cause cancer humans particularly controversial area research It currently unclear whether SV role causing tumors As result uncertainties academic opinion remains divided arguing hypothesis supported data others arguing cancers may involve SV The US National Cancer Institute announced although SV cause cancer animal models "substantial epidemiological evidence accumulated indicate SV likely cause cancer humans" This announcement based two studies This announcement contrast study performed The National Academy Sciences Immunization Safety Review committee stated "The committee concludes biological evidence moderate SV exposure could lead cancer humans natural conditions" SV may act cocarcinogen crocidolite asbestos cause mesothelioma The mechanism may involve suppression transcriptional properties tumor suppressor p humans SV large T antigen SV small Tantigen Tumor suppressor p responsible initiating regulated cell death "apoptosis" cell cycle arrest cell damaged A mutated p gene may contribute uncontrolled cellular proliferation leading tumor Some vaccines made USA found contaminated SV growth medium original seed strain Population level studies show extensive evidence increase cancer incidence result exposure though SV extensively studied A thirtyfive year followup find excess numbers cancers associated SV SV consists unenveloped icosahedral virion closed circular doublestranded DNA genome kb The virion adheres cell surface receptors MHC class I virion glycoprotein VP Penetration cell caveolin vesicle Inside cell nucleus cellular RNA polymerase II acts promote early gene expression This results mRNA spliced two segments The small large T antigens result The large T antigen two functions goes plasma cell membrane returns nucleus Once nucleus large T antigen binds three viral DNA sites I II III Binding sites I II autoregulates early RNA synthesis Binding site II takes place cell cycle Binding site I initiates DNA replication origin replication Early transcription gives two spliced RNAs Late transcription gives longer synthesizes major viral capsid protein VP smaller gives VP VP leaky scanning All proteins besides large T return nucleus assembly viral particle happens A putative late protein VP reported act viroporin facilitiating release viral particles resulting cytolysis however presence role VP disputed SV capable multiplicity reactivation MR MR process two virus genomes containing otherwise lethal damage interact within infected cell form viable virus genome Yamamato Shimojo observed MR SV virions irradiated UV light allowed undergo multiple infection host cells Hall studied MR SV virions exposed DNA crosslinking agent trimethylpsoralen Under conditions single virus particle entered host cell approximately one DNA crosslink lethal virus could repaired In contrast multiple viral genomes infected host cell psoraleninduced DNA crosslinks repaired MR occurred Hall suggested virions crosslinked DNA repaired recombinational repair Michod et al reviewed numerous examples MR different viruses suggested MR common form sexual interaction provides advantage recombinational repair genome damages The early promoter SV contains three elements The TATA box located approximately basepairs upstream transcriptional start site The basepair repeats contain six GC boxes site determines direction transcription Also basepair repeats transcriptional enhancers When SP protein interacts basepair repeats binds either first last three GC boxes Binding first three initiates early expression binding last three initiates late expression The function basepair repeats enhance amount stable RNA increase rate synthesis This done binding dimerization AP transcription factor give primary transcript polyadenylated cappedcitation needed SV dormant asymptomatic rhesus monkeys The virus found many macaque populations wild rarely causes disease However monkeys immunodeficientdue example infection simian immunodeficiency virusSV acts much like human JC BK polyomaviruses producing kidney disease sometimes demyelinating disease similar progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy In species particularly hamsters SV causes variety tumors generally sarcomas In rats oncogenic SV large T antigen used establish brain tumor model primitive neuroectodermal tumor medulloblastoma The molecular mechanisms virus reproduces alters cell function previously unknown research SV vastly increased biologists understanding gene expression regulation cell growthcitation needed SV first identified Ben Sweet Maurice Hilleman found polio vaccines USA contaminated SV In Bernice Eddy described SV oncogenic function inducing sarcoma ependymomas hamsters inoculated monkeys cells infected SV The complete viral genome sequenced Weissman Yale University USA also Fiers team University Ghent Belgium
