Japanese encephalitis JE infection brain caused Japanese encephalitis virus JEV While infections result little symptoms occasional inflammation brain occurs In cases symptoms may include headache vomiting fever confusion seizures This occurs days infection JEV generally spread mosquitoes specifically Culex type Pigs wild birds serve reservoir virus The disease occurs mostly outside cities Diagnosis based blood cerebrospinal fluid testing Prevention generally Japanese encephalitis vaccine safe effective Other measures include avoiding mosquito bites Once infected specific treatment care supportive This generally carried hospital Permanent problems occur half people recover JE The disease primarily occurs East Southeast Asia well Western Pacific About billion people live areas disease occurs About symptomatic cases occur year deaths Often cases occur outbreaks The disease first described Japan The Japanese encephalitis virus JEV incubation period days The vast majority infections asymptomatic infections develop encephalitis Severe rigors may mark onset disease humans Fever headache malaise nonspecific symptoms disease may last period days Signs develop acute encephalitic stage include neck rigidity cachexia hemiparesis convulsions raised body temperature – °C – °F Mental retardation usually developed Mortality disease varies generally higher children Transplacental spread noted Lifelong neurological defects deafness emotional lability hemiparesis may occur central nervous system involvement In known cases effects also include nausea headache fever vomitingcitation

production molecules amplify mounting response damage also evident nonregenerating organ brain dysregulated innate immune response would deleterious In JE tight regulation microglial activation appears disturbed resulting autotoxic loop microglial activation possibly leads bystander neuronal damage In animals key signs include infertility abortion pigs neurological disease horses systemic

commercially available tests detecting JE virusspecific IgM antibodies serum andor cerebrospinal fluid example IgM capture ELISA JE virus IgM antibodies usually detectable days onset illness persist
