Eikenella corrodens Gramnegative facultative anaerobic bacillus cause severe invasive disease humans. It first identified M. Eiken , called Bacteroides corrodens. E. corrodens rare pericarditis associated pathogen. It fastidious, slow growing, human commensal bacillus, capable acting opportunistic pathogen causing abscesses several anatomical sites, including liver, lung, spleen, submandibular region. E. corrodens could independently cause serious infection immunocompetent immunocompromised hosts. Eikenella corrodens pleomorphic bacillus sometimes appears coccobacillary typically creates depression "pit" agar growing. Only half produce pitting agar considered characteristic.citation needed. It slowgrowing, facultative, anaerobic gramnegative bacillus. It grows aerobic anaerobic conditions, requires atmosphere enhanced â€“ carbon dioxide.citation needed The colonies small greyish, produce greenish discoloration underlying agar, smell faintly bleach hypochlorite.citation needed They oxidasepositive, catalasenegative, ureasenegative, indolenegative, reduce nitrate nitrite.citation needed In , Azakami et al reported periodontal pathogen E. corrodens ortholog luxS, gene required quorum sensing QS signal molecule AI synthesis E. corrodens produce AI signal celltocell communication AI role biofilm formation E. corrodens. Karim et al reported bacterium produce AI inactivation enzyme stationary phase. Karim et al also reported LuxSmediated QS may facilitate maturation detachment biofilm formation E.corrodens, leads progression periodontal disease. Eikenella corrodens commensal human mouth upper respiratory tract. It unusual cause infection cultured, usually found mixed organisms. Infections commonly occur patients cancers head neck, occur human bite infections, especially "reverse bite", "fight bite", "clenched fist injuries". It also cause infections insulindependent diabetics intravenous drug users lick needles "needlelicker's osteomyelitis". It one HACEK group infections cause culturenegative endocarditis. In general, HACEK organisms responsible approximately cases infective endocarditis IE. IE due E. corrodens usually result poor oral hygiene periodontal infection. Manipulation gingival oral mucosa dental procedures also predispose patients infection since E. corrodens constituent human oral flora. E. corrodens coexists frequently detected pathogens including Staphylococcus Streptococcus. Eikenella corrodens infections typically indolent infection become clinically evident week injury. They also mimic anaerobic infection extremely foulsmelling.citation needed Eikenella corrodens mentioned episode Forensic Files, hotel employee punched woman mouth, knocking two teeth. The tooth bacteria caused major infection man's hand. For accurate diagnoses, high degree suspicion required order properly attribute infection Eikenella corrodens. The identification E. corrodens may delayed slow growth absence CO. E. corrodens treated penicillins, cephalosporins, tetracyclines, however due resistant nature bacteria ongoing recurring symptoms expected despite rigorous prolonged antibiotic treatment. Submandibular peritonsillar abscesses caused E. corrodens treated incision drainage. Earlier diagnosis proper drainage surgery effective antibiotics treatment may improve prognosis. Firstchoice drugs E. corrodens infections thirdgeneration cephems, carbapenems, new quinolones. It innately resistant macrolides e.g., erythromycin, clindamycin, metronidazole. It susceptible fluoroquinolones e.g., ciprofloxacin vitro, clinical evidence available advocate use infections.
