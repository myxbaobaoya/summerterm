One obstacles treatment human immunodeficiency virus HIV high genetic variability HIV divided two major types HIV type HIV HIV type HIV HIV related viruses found chimpanzees gorillas living western Africa HIV viruses related viruses found sooty mangabey vulnerable West African primate HIV viruses may divided groups The HIV group M viruses predominate responsible AIDS pandemic Group M subdivided subtypes based genetic sequence data Some subtypes known virulent resistant different medications Likewise HIV viruses thought less virulent transmissible HIV M group viruses although HIV also known cause AIDS HIV common pathogenic strain virus Over million infections occur annually Scientists divide HIV major group Group M two minor groups namely Group N O possibly group P Each group believed represent independent transmission SIV humans subtypes within group A total ORFs found six possible reading frames RFs HIV complete genome sequence functional With M "major" far common type HIV HIVAIDS cases deriving infection HIV group M This major HIV virus source pre pandemic viruses originated LÃ©opoldville Belgian Congo today known Kinshasa capital Democratic Republic Congo DRC Its zoonotic origin SIVcpz infects chimpanzees The M group subdivided clades called subtypes also given letter There also "circulating recombinant forms" CRFs derived recombination viruses different subtypes given number CRFBF example recombination subtypes B F The spatial movement subtypes moved along railways waterways Democratic Republic Congo DRC Kinshasa areas These subtypes sometimes split subsubtypes A A F Fcitation needed In strain CRF recombinant subtype A subtype D subtype G subtype D protease found strongly associated rapid progression AIDS Cuba This thought complete final list types likely found The N stands "nonM nonO" This group discovered FrancoCameroonian team identified isolated HIV variant strain YBF Cameroonian woman died AIDS When tested YBF variant reacted envelope antigen SIVcpz rather Group M Group O indicating indeed novel strain HIV As fewer Group N infections recorded The O "Outlier" group infected individuals located WestCentral Africa usually seen outside area It reportedly common Cameroon survey found HIVpositive samples Group O Its zoonotic origin SIVgor infects gorillas rather common source SIVcpz The group caused concern could detected early versions HIV test kits More advanced HIV tests developed detect Group O Group N In newly analyzed HIV sequence reported greater similarity simian immunodeficiency virus recently discovered wild gorillas SIVgor SIVs chimpanzees SIVcpz The virus isolated Cameroonian woman residing France diagnosed HIV infection The scientists reporting sequence placed proposed Group P "pending identification human cases" HIV widely recognized outside Africa The first identification HIV occurred Senegal microbiologist Souleymane Mboup collaborators The first case United States The first confirmed case HIV Portuguese man treated London Hospital Tropical Diseases later died He believed exposed disease GuineaBissau lived His pathological diagnosis time cryptosporidium enterovirus infection analysis stored serum found infected HIV Many test kits HIV also detect HIV As eight known HIV groups A H Of groups A B pandemic Group A found mainly West Africa also spread globally Angola Mozambique Brazil India Europe US Despite presence HIV globally Group B mainly confined West Africa Despite relative confinement HIV considered patients exhibiting symptoms HIV come West Africa also anyone body fluid transfer person West Africa ie needle sharing sexual contact etc HIV closely related simian immunodeficiency virus endemic sooty mangabeys Cercocebus atys atys SIVsmm monkey species inhabiting forests Littoral West Africa Phylogenetic analyses show virus closely related two strains HIV spread considerably humans HIV groups A B SIVsmm found sooty mangabeys Tai forest western Ivory Coast There six additional known HIV groups found one person They seem derive independent transmissions sooty mangabeys humans Groups C D found two people Liberia groups E F discovered two people Sierra Leone groups G H detected two people Ivory Coast Each HIV strains humans probably deadend hosts closely related SIVsmm strains sooty mangabeys living country human infection found HIV diagnosis made patient symptoms positive blood work indicating individual HIV The Multispot HIVHIV Rapid Test currently FDA approved method differentiation two viruses Recommendations screening diagnosis HIV always use enzyme immunoassays detect HIV HIV group O HIV When screening combination test positive followed indeterminate HIV western blot follow test amino acid testing must performed distinguish infection present According NIH differential diagnosis HIV considered person West African descent sexual contact shared needles person West Africa highest risk origin viruscitation needed HIV found less pathogenic HIV The mechanism HIV clearly defined difference HIV however transmission rate much lower HIV HIV Both viruses lead AIDS infected individuals mutate develop drug resistance Disease monitoring patients HIV includes clinical evaluation CD cell counts treatment includes antiretroviral therapy ART nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors NRTIs protease inhibitors PI nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors NNRTIs addition CCR coreceptor antagonists fusion inhibitors Choice initial andor secondline therapy HIV yet defined HIV appears resistant NNRTIs intrinsically may sensitive NRTIs though mechanism poorly understood Protease inhibitors shown variable effect integrase inhibitors also evaluated Combination regimens listed therapies looked well also showing variable effect depending types therapies combined While mechanisms clearly understood HIV HIV known use different pathways patterns making algorithms used evaluate HIV resistanceassociated mutations irrelevant HIV Each virus contracted individually contracted together referred coinfection HIV seems lower mortality rates less severe symptoms slower progression AIDS HIV alone coinfection In coinfection however largely dependent virus contracted first HIV tends compete HIV disease progression Coinfection seems growing problem globally time progresses cases identified West African countries well cases USA If pregnant mother exposed screening performed normal If HIV present number perinatal ART drugs may given prophylactic lower risk mothertochild transmission After child born standard sixweek regimen prophylactics initiated Breast milk may also contain particles HIV therefore breastfeeding strictly advised The rapid evolution HIV attributed high mutation rate During early stages mutation evolution appears neutral due absence evolutionary response However examining virus several different individuals convergent mutations found appearing viral populations independently HIV evolution within host influences factors including virus setpoint viral load If virus low setpoint viral load host live longer greater probability virus transmitted another individual If virus high setpoint viral load host live shorter amount time lower probability virus transmitted another individual HIV evolved maximize number infections hosts tendency selection favor intermediate strains shows HIV undergoes stabilizing selection The virus also evolved become infectious hosts There three different mechanisms allow HIV evolve population level One includes continuous battle evolve overcome immune system slows evolution HIV shifts virus focus towards population level Another includes slow evolution viral load due viral load mutations neutral within host The last mechanism focuses virus preference transmit founding viral strains stored early stages infection This preference virus transmit stored genome copies explains HIV evolves quickly within host hosts HIV evolving milder form "an awfully long way" longer deadly new severe variants still appearing Isolates HIV HIV resistance antiretroviral drugs arise natural selection genetic mutations tracked analyzed The
