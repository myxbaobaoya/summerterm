Veillonella parvula strictly anaerobic, Gramnegative, coccusshaped bacterium genus Veillonella. It normal part oral flora associated diseases periodontitis dental caries well various systemic infections, including meningitis osteomyelitis. It also isolated women bacterial vaginosis associated hypertension together Campylobacter rectus Prevotella melaninogenica. V. parvula unable feed carbohydrates, feed lactate provided Streptococcus species also found oral cavity. Specifically, Streptococcus mutans V. parvula form multispecies biofilms lead lower susceptibility antimicrobial treatments, resulting periodontitis dental carries. V. parvula bacteria susceptible typically treated metronidazole penicillin clinical reports. Other antibiotics shown active V. parvula include cephalosporin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol. There several reports antibiotic resistance V. parvula isolates different countries. In Greece, V. parvula isolates found somewhat resistant penicillin, ampicillin, piperacillintazobactam, clindamycin, moxifloxacin, reported resistance metronidazole. In Taiwan, V. parvula isolates found resistant metronidazole. These findings represent growing issue antibiotic resistance worldwide. Mashima I, Nakazawa F August .
