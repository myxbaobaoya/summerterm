Powassan virus POWV Flavivirus transmitted ticks found North America Russian Far East It named town Powassan Ontario identified young boy eventually died It cause encephalitis infection brain No approved vaccine antiviral drug exists Prevention tick bites best precaution Powassan virus POWV Flavivirus named town Powassan Ontario Canadawhere identified yearold boy died encephalitis The virus exists North America causes longterm neurological sequelae The first human case United States found New Jersey Russia As update Powassan virus noted tickborne Flavivirus North America human pathogenicity Powassan virus also found warm climate across Eurasia part tickborne encephalitis viruscomplex It found Russian Far East Primorsky Krai appears introduced years ago Powassan virus RNA virus split two separate lineages Lineage I labeled prototype lineage Lineage II deer tick virus DTV lineage Lineage II genetic variation indicates likely ancestral lineage split result positive natural selection DTV closely related Powassan virus sequence analysis showed two viruses diverged years ago Even though Lineage II predominant POWV positive tick pools lineages confirmed cases human disease North America Russia The lineages share nucleotide sequences amino acid sequence identity Crossneutralization occurs among flaviviruses due conservation envelope protein contributes fact two lineages serologically indistinguishable As result lineages part viral species According last data evolutionary rate Powassan virus × − nucleotide substitution per site per year HPD × −– × − significantly lower values reported previous studies The values compatible tickborne encephalitis virus TBEV loupingill virus LIV × −– × − TBEV × −– × − LIV The recent common ancestor modern POWV split two independent genetic lineages years ago probably result Beringia flood thousand years ago The virus transmitted bites altogether six known species ticks following four species Ixodes ticks Ixodes cookei Ixodes scapularis Ixodes marxi Ixodes spinipalpus ticks Dermacentor andersoni Dermacentor variabilis People POWV mostly confirmed one strain POWV deer tick virus Ix scapularis important vector Deer Tick Virus plays vital role maintaining POWV Ix scapularis also primary vector agent Lyme disease generalist feeders readily bite humans In Canada Northeastern United States Ixodes cookei predominant species Ix scapularis significant vector Minnesota Wisconsin POWV transmitted infected tick bites mammal humans tick typically Ix scapularis In North America lineages POWV maintained three main enzootic cycles involving three different tick species respective small mediumsized woodland mammals POWV may infect Ix cookei woodchucks may infect Ix marxi squirrels cycle Ix scapularis whitefooted mice Based time interval tickborne diseases like Lyme disease anaplasmosis time interval transmission POWV expected less hours Once POWV reaches humans cannot transmitted feeding tick therefore humans considered "deadend" hosts As update fastest transmission time DTV Ix scapularis nymph mouse minutes Powassan virus infection rarely diagnosed cause encephalitis however Powassan encephalitis severe neurologic sequelae common Powassan encephalitis symptoms compatible acute disseminated encephalomyelitis oftentimes making difficult diagnose Powassan virus encephalitis challenge diagnose laboratories offer testing effective serologic testing There currently medications approved vaccines treat prevent POWV People affected Powassan virus generally first show symptoms weeks infection The initial symptoms include fever headache nausea occasional confusion weakness With severe Powassan illnesses victims hospitalized symptoms worsen If treated symptoms could extend meningoencephalitis may include seizures aphasia cranial nerve palsies paresis altered mental status Currently best ways treat POWV illnesses include medications reduce brain swelling respiratory support intravenous fluids About POWV encephalitis cases fatal half survivors permanent symptoms affect brain There confirmed cases Powassan virus infection US A rare case fivemonthold Connecticut infant boy contracting Powassan virus infection published He survived normal motor verbal development followup age months head MRI showed severely abnormal brain conditions including scarring gliosis softening encephalomalacia thalamus basal ganglia sides volume loss early mineralization left basal ganglia On October former US Senator Kay Hagan died contracting Powassan virus She years old In March Connecticut Department Public Health confirmed man aged contracted Powassan virus state hospitalised severe neurological symptoms though later discharged hospital recover home Powassan Virus POWV tickborne flavivirus endemic North America POWV human illnesses reported United States Canada Russia POWV different genetic variations including deer tick virus DTV transmitted black legged deer tick Ixodes scapularis It two distinct lineages POWV lineage I transmitted Ixodes cookei endemic Great Lakes region United States POWV lineage II transmitted Ixodes scapularis endemic Northeast United States Humans become infected minutes tick attachment Ixodes ticks three life stages require host larva nymph adult Each stage requires blood meal progress next life stage The nymph stage frequently bites humans stage I scapularis likely infect human host pathogen The common reservoir host I scapularis whitefooted mouse whitetail deer The common reservoirs I cookei skunks woodchucks squirrels Humans incidental hosts means ticks need feed humans survive humans merely host find time next blood meal In US highest incidence POWV Minnesota Wisconsin Massachusetts New York also higher incidence states Great Lakes Northeast region POWV included list nationally notifiable diseases US Centers Disease Control Prevention CDC Between cases neuroinvasive POWV cases nonneuroinvasive POWV reported CDC Since discovery reported human illnesses caused POWV The incidence rate POWV United States case per year risen average cases per year since Currently POWV detected IgM antibody capture ELISA IgM
