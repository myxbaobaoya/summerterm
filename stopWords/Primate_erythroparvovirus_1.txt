Primate erythroparvovirus generally referred B virus BV parvovirus B sometimes erythrovirus B first known human virus family Parvoviridae genus Erythroparvovirus measures – nm diameter The name derived Latin parvum meaning small reflecting fact B ranks among smallest DNA viruses B virus known causing disease pediatric population however also affect adults It classic cause childhood rash called fifth disease erythema infectiosum "slapped cheek syndrome" The virus discovered chance Australian virologist Yvonne Cossart It gained B name discovered well B large series microtiter plates Erythroviruses belong Parvoviridae family small DNA viruses Human parvovirus B nonenveloped icosahedral virus contains singlestranded linear DNA genome approximately base pairs length The infectious particles may contain either positive negative strands DNA The icosahedral capsid consists capsomeres consisting two structural proteins VP kDa VP kDa identical except amino acids aminoterminal VPprotein socalled VPunique region VP major capsid protein comprises approximately total virus particle VPproteins incorporated capsid structure nonstoichiometrical relation based antibodybinding analysis Xray structural analysis VPunique region assumed exposed surface virus particle At end DNA molecule palindromic sequences form "hairpin" loops The hairpin end serves primer DNA polymerase It classified erythrovirus capability invade red blood cell precursors bone marrow Three genotypes subtypes recognised The genome human parvovirus B encodes four proteins addition VP VP The notable large nonstructural protein commonly referred NS NS sequencespecifically binds cleaves DNA via restriction endonuclease activity Nterminus NS responsible regulation certain cellular promoters including pWAF promoter thought regulate virus promoter The kDa protein encoded viral genome implicated viral DNA replication The nucleotide substitution rate total coding DNA estimated x − substitutionssiteyear This rate similar singlestranded DNA viruses VP codons found purifying selection In contrast VP codons unique part gene found diversifying selection This diversifying selection consistent persistent infection part VP protein contains epitopes recognised immune systemcitation needed Like nonenveloped DNA viruses pathogenicity parvovirus B involves binding host cell receptors internalization translocation genome host nucleus DNA replication RNA transcription assembly capsids packaging genome finally cell lysis release mature virions In humans P antigen also known globoside cellular receptor parvovirus B virus causes erythema infectiosum fifth disease children This infection sometimes complicated severe aplastic anemia caused lysis early erythroid precursorscitation needed The recent common ancestor extant strains dated years ago Three genotypes recognised A recombination types gave rise genotype years agocitation needed The virus primarily spread infected respiratory droplets bloodborne transmission however reported The secondary attack risk exposed household persons half classroom contacts Symptoms begin six days exposure days average days last week Infected patients normal immune systems contagious becoming symptomatic probably Individuals B IgG antibodies generally considered immune recurrent infection reinfection possible minority cases About half adults Bimmune due past infection A significant increase number cases seen every three four years last epidemic year Outbreaks arise especially nurseries schools Parvovirus B causes infection humans Cat dog parvoviruses infect humans There vaccine available human parvovirus B though attempts made develop one Fifth disease erythema infectiosum one several expressions parvovirus B The associated bright red rash cheeks gives nickname "slapped cheek syndrome" Any age may affected although common children aged six ten years It named fifth common cause pinkred infection associated rash described physicians many others measles rubella rare Once infected patients usually develop illness incubation period four fourteen days The disease commences high fever malaise virus abundant bloodstream patients usually longer infectious characteristic rash disease appeared The following symptoms characteristic Teenagers young adults may develop socalled "Papular Purpuric Gloves Socks Syndrome" Parvovirus B cause chronic anemia individuals AIDS It frequently overlooked Treatment intravenous immunoglobulin usually resolves anemia although relapse occur The parvovirus infection may trigger inflammatory reaction AIDS patients begun antiretroviral therapy Arthralgias arthritis commonly reported association parvovirus B infection adults whereas erythema infectiosum main symptom observed children The occurrence arthralgia coincides initial detection circulating IgM IgGantibodies viral structural proteins VP VP Parvovirus B infection may affect development arthritis In adults perhaps children parvovirus B lead seronegative arthritis usually easily controlled analgesics Women approximately twice likely men experience arthritis parvovirus infection Possibly new cases arthritis due parvovirus history recent contact patient positive serology generally confirms diagnosis This arthritis progress forms arthritis Typically joint symptoms last – weeks – affected may last weeks months A Danish study links B polymyalgia rheumatica Although patients decrease erythropoiesis production red blood cells parvovirus infection dangerous patients preexisting bone marrow stress example sickle cell anemia hereditary spherocytosis therefore heavily dependent erythropoiesis due reduced lifespan red cells This termed "aplastic crisis" also called reticulocytopenia It treated blood transfusion Parvovirus infection pregnant women associated hydrops fetalis due severe fetal anemia sometimes leading miscarriage stillbirth This due combination hemolysis red blood cells well virus directly negatively affecting red blood cell precursors bone marrow The risk fetal loss infection occurs pregnancy week especially weeks minimal Routine screening antenatal sample would enable pregnant mother determine risk infectioncitation needed Knowledge status would allow mother avoid contact individuals suspected known ongoing infection however present time antenatal testing immunity recommended since good means prevent infection specific therapy vaccines available It may increase maternal anxiety fear without proven benefit The best approach would recommend pregnant women avoid contact children current symptoms infection described The risk fetus reduced correct diagnosis anemia ultrasound scans treatment blood transfusions There evidence intrauterine parvovirus B infection leads developmental abnormalities childhood At moment treatments directly target parvovirus B virus Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy IVIG therapy popular alternative doctors administer without stopping chemotherapy drugs like MELASCT Also treatments side effects rare patients complications acute kidney injury pulmonary edema even though patients organ transplants HIV positive This large improvement administering rituximabcitation needed The monoclonal antibody CD protein shown cause acute hepatitis neutropenia via parvovirus B reactivations even persistent parvovirus B infection However important note IVIG therapy perfect treated patients relapse months As approved human vaccine existed parvovirus B
