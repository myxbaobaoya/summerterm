Human polyomavirus commonly referred JC virus John Cunningham virus type human polyomavirus formerly known papovavirus It identified electron microscopy ZuRhein Chou Silverman Rubinstein later isolated culture named using two initials patient John Cunningham progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy PML The virus causes PML diseases cases immunodeficiency AIDS treatment immunosuppressive drugs eg organ transplant patients The initial site infection may tonsils possibly gastrointestinal tract The virus remains latent gastrointestinal tract also infect tubular epithelial cells kidneys continues reproduce shedding virus particles urine In addition recent studies suggest virus may latently infect human semen well chorionic villi tissues Serum antibodies Human polyomavirus also found spontaneous abortion affected women well women underwent voluntary interruption pregnancy Human polyomavirus cross blood–brain barrier central nervous system infects oligodendrocytes astrocytes possibly HTA serotonin receptor Human polyomavirus DNA detected nonPML affected PMLaffected see brain tissue Human polyomavirus found central nervous system PML patients almost invariably differences promoter sequence Human polyomavirus found healthy individuals It thought differences promoter sequence contribute fitness virus CNS thus development PML Certain transcription factors present early promoter sequences Human polyomavirus induce tropism viral proliferation leads PML The SpiB factor shown crucial initiating viral replication certain strains transgenic mice The protein encoded early sequences Tantigen also plays key role viral proliferation directing initiation DNA replication virus well performing transcriptional switch allow formation various capsid regulatory proteins needed viral fitness Further research needed determine exact etiological role Tantigen seems connection early initiation active virus archetypal dormant state Immunodeficiency immunosuppression allows Human polyomavirus reactivate In brain causes often fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy PML destroying oligodendrocytes Whether represents reactivation Human polyomavirus within CNS seeding newly reactivated Human polyomavirus via blood lymphatics unknown Several studies since suggested virus also linked colorectal cancer Human polyomavirus found malignant colon tumors findings still controversial Although Human polyomavirus infection classically associated white matter demyelination PML pathogenesis recent literature identified viral variants etiological agents novel syndromes For example Human polyomavirus found infect granule cell layer cerebellum sparing purkinje fibers ultimately causing severe cerebellar atrophy This syndrome called JCV granule cell layer neuronopathy JCV GCN characterized productive lytic infection JC variant mutation VP coding region Human polyomavirus also appears mediate encephalopathy due infection cortical pyramidal neurons CPN astrocytes Analysis JCV CPN variant revealed differences JCV GCN mutations found VP coding region however –basepair deletion identified agnogene coding –aminoacid truncated peptide believed mediate CPN tropism Additionally analysis subcellular localization JC CPN virions nuclei cytoplasm axons suggests virus may travel axons increase infectivity Human polyomavirus may also causative agent aseptic meningitis JCVM Human polyomavirus pathogen identified CSF certain patients meningitis Analysis JCVM variant revealed archetypelike regulatory regions mutations coding sequences The precise molecular mechanisms mediating Human polyomavirus meningeal tropism remains found The virus common general population infecting humans people acquire Human polyomavirus childhood adolescence It found high concentrations urban sewage worldwide leading researchers suspect contaminated water typical route infection Minor genetic variations found consistently different geographic areas thus genetic analysis Human polyomavirus samples useful tracing history human migration subtypes genotypes recognised associated specific geographical region Three found Europe b c A minor African typeAfoccurs Central West Africa The major African typeAfis found throughout Africa also West South Asia Several Asian types recognised Ba Bb Bd B CY MY SC An alternative numbering scheme numbers genotypes – additional lettering Types found Europe indigenous populations northern Japan NorthEast Siberia northern Canada These two types closely related Types found subSaharan Africa type isolated Ethiopia Tanzania South Africa Type found Ghana Both types also found Biaka Pygmies Bantus Central Africa Type several variants subtype A found mainly Japanese population Native Americans excluding Inuit B found Eurasians D found Indians E found Australians western Pacific populations Subtype A found southern China SouthEast Asia Subtype B found northern China Mongolia Japan Subtype C found northern southern China Subtype found Papua New Guinea Pacific Islands The geographic distribution JC polyomavirus types may help trace humans different continents JC genotyping Since immunodeficiency causes virus progress PML immunosuppressants contraindicated infected The boxed warning drug rituximab Rituxan includes statement Human polyomavirus infection resulting progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy death
