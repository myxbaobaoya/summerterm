Herpes simplex virus Human alphaherpesvirus HHV species virus genus Simplexvirus subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae family Herpesviridae order Herpesvirales Human alphaherpesvirus divided two clades one globally distributed mostly limited sub Saharan Africa Human alphaherpesvirus infects humans often genital herpes In United States one six people virus It primarily sexually transmitted infection Human alphaherpesvirus tends reside sacral ganglia Human alphaherpesvirus periodically shed human genital tract often asymptomatically Most sexual transmissions occur periods asymptomatic shedding Asymptomatic reactivation means virus causes atypical subtle hardtonotice symptoms identified active herpes infection acquiring virus possible even active blisters sores present In one study daily genital swab samples found Human alphaherpesvirus median â€“ days among outbreak days among suffering asymptomatic infection many episodes occurring without visible outbreak "subclinical shedding" In another study subjects randomized receive valaciclovir g daily placebo days twoway crossover design A daily swab genital area selfcollected Human alphaherpesvirus detection polymerase chain reaction compare effect valaciclovir versus placebo asymptomatic viral shedding immunocompetent seropositive subjects without history symptomatic genital herpes infection The study found valaciclovir significantly reduced shedding subclinical days compared placebo showing reduction subjects shedding receiving valaciclovir versus subjects placebo About patients treated valaciclovir recognized signs symptoms versus placebo For Human alphaherpesvirus subclinical shedding may account transmission Studies discordant partners one infected one show transmission rate approximately per sexual contacts Atypical symptoms often attributed causes yeast infection
