The Semliki Forest virus alphavirus found central eastern southern Africa It first isolated mosquitoes Semliki Forest Uganda Uganda Virus Research Institute described Smithburn Haddow It known cause disease animals including humans The Semliki Forest virus positivestrand RNA virus genome approximately base pairs encodes nine proteins The two thirds genome encode four nonstructural proteins concerned RNA synthesis structural proteins encoded one third Of structural proteins C proteins make icosahedral capsid enveloped lipid bilayer derived host cell The outermost surface virus almost entirely covered heterodimers glycoproteins E E arranged interconnective trimers form outer shell Trimers anchored membrane E cytoplasmic domain associates nucleocapsid Replication occurs via negative strand intermediate giving rise full length genomic RNA export new virions subgenomic message translated structural proteins Semliki Forest virus spread mainly mosquito bites It able infect mammals inhalation gastrointestinal exposure although rodents laboratory infected intranasal instillation The virus able cause lethal encephalitis rodents generally mild symptoms humans Only one lethal human infection reported In one case patient speculated immunodeficient potentially exposed large amounts virus laboratory Semliki Forest virus used extensively biological research model viral life cycle viral neuropathy Due broad host range efficient replication also developed vector genes encoding vaccines anticancer agents tool gene therapy Since Semliki Forest virus naturally infects cells central nervous system preclinically tested oncolytic virus aggressive brain tumour type glioblastoma The SFV virus genetically modified microRNA target sequences replicated brain tumour cells normal brain cells The modified virus reduced tumour growth prolonged survival mice brain tumours The modified virus also found efficiently kill human glioblastoma tumour cell lines
