Hendra virus scientific name Hendra henipavirus batborne virus associated highly fatal infection horses humans Numerous disease outbreaks Australia among horses caused Hendra virus The Hendra virus belongs genus Henipavirus also contains Nipah virus also caused disease outbreaks Flying foxes experimentally infected Hendra virus develop viraemia shed virus urine faeces saliva approximately one week There indication illness Symptoms Hendra virus infection humans may respiratory including hemorrhage edema lungs cases viral meningitis In horses infection usually causes one pulmonary oedema congestion neurological signs Ephrin B identified main receptor henipaviruses Flying foxes identified reservoir host Hendra virus A seroprevalence found flying foxes suggesting endemic infection bat population throughout Australia Horses become infected Hendra exposure bodily fluid infected flying fox This often happens form urine feces masticated fruit covered flying foxs saliva horses allowed graze roosting sites The seven human cases infected contact sick horses As result veterinarians particularly risk contracting disease Three main approaches currently followed reduce risk humans Hendra virus originally called "Equine morbillivirus" discovered September caused deaths thirteen horses trainer training complex Williams Avenue Hendra suburb Brisbane Queensland Australia The index case mare called Drama Series brought paddock Cannon Hill housed horses falling ill died two days later Subsequently horses became ill dying The remaining six animals subsequently euthanised way preventing relapsing infection possible transmission The trainer Victory Vic Rail stable foreman Ray Unwin involved nursing index case fell ill influenzalike illness within one week first horses death The stable hand recovered Rail died respiratory kidney failure The source virus likely frothy nasal discharge index case A second outbreak occurred August chronologically preceding first outbreak Mackay km north Brisbane resulting deaths two horses owner The owner assisted necropsies horses within three weeks admitted hospital suffering meningitis He recovered months later developed neurologic signs died This outbreak diagnosed retrospectively presence Hendra virus brain patient As June total fifty outbreaks Hendra virus occurred Australia involving infection horses As result events eightythree horses died euthanized A four died euthanized result possible Hendra infection Case fatality rate humans horses Four outbreaks spread humans result direct contact infected horses On July dog living Mt Alford property reported HeV antibodies first time animal flying fox horse human tested positive outside experimental situation These events east coast Australia northern event Cairns Queensland event furthest south Kempsey New South Wales Until event Chinchilla Queensland July outbreak sites within distribution least two four mainland flying foxes fruit bats Little red flying fox Pteropus scapulatus black flying fox Pteropus alecto greyheaded flying fox Pteropus poliocephalus spectacled flying fox Pteropus conspicillatus Chinchilla considered within range little red flying fox west Great Dividing Range This furthest west infection ever identified horses The timing incidents indicates seasonal pattern outbreaks Initially thought possibly related breeding cycle little red flying foxes These species typically give birth April May Subsequently however Spectacled flying fox Black flying fox identified species likely involved infection spillovers Timing outbreaks also appears likely cooler months possible temperature humidity favourable longer term survival virus environment There evidence transmission humans directly bats appears human infection occurs via intermediate host horse Despite NSW Government approved destruction flying fox colonies In years – fourteen events recorded Between June August seventeen events identified twentyone horses died It clear sudden increase number spillover events June August Typically HeV spillover events common May October This time sometimes called "Hendra Season" time large numbers fruit bats species congregated SE Queenslands valuable winter foraging habitat The weather warm humid favourable survival henipavirus environment It possible flooding SE Queensland Northern NSW December January may affected health fruit bats Urine sampling flying fox camps indicate larger proportion flying foxes usual shedding live virus Biosecurity Queenslands ongoing surveillance usually shows animals shedding live virus In June July nearly animals reported shedding live virus Present advice events driven mutation HeV Other suggestions include increase testing led increase detection As actual mode transmission bats horses determined clear factors increase chance infection horses Following confirmation dog HeV antibodies July Queensland NSW governments boost research funding Hendra virus million spent – This
