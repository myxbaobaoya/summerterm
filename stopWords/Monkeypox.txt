Monkeypox infectious viral disease occur humans animals Early symptoms include fever headache muscle pains shivering backache feeling extremely tired Typically swollen lymph nodes behind ear jaw neck groin This followed rash forms blisters crusts frequently mouth face hands feet genitals eyes The time exposure onset symptoms average days though ranges days The duration symptoms typically two four weeks Cases may severe especially children pregnant women people suppressed immune systems Monkeypox may spread handling bushmeat animal bite scratch body fluids contaminated objects close contact infected person The virus normally circulates among certain rodents Diagnosis confirmed testing lesion viruss DNA The disease appear similar chickenpox The smallpox vaccine prevent infection effectiveness smallpox vaccination stopped parts world late resulting little immunity monkeypox In monkeypox vaccine Jynneos approved adults United States The current standard treatment tecovirimat antiviral specifically intended treat infections orthopoxviruses smallpox monkeypox It approved treatment monkeypox European Union United States Cidofovir brincidofovir may also useful Reports risk death untreated high Congo Basin Central African clade monkeypox Monkeypox first identified among laboratory monkeys Copenhagen Denmark Monkeys natural reservoir virus The first cases humans found Democratic Republic Congo An outbreak occurred United States traced pet store rodents imported Ghana sold The monkeypox outbreak represents first incidence widespread community transmission outside Africa began United Kingdom May subsequent cases confirmed least countries Europe North America South America Asia North Africa Australia Monkeypox zoonotic poxvirus infection occur humans animals Two recognised distinct types described Congo Basin clade milder West African clade Early symptoms include headache muscle pains fever fatigue It may initially appear like flu The disease resemble chickenpox measles smallpox distinguished presence swollen glands These characteristically appear behind ear jaw neck groin onset rash Within days fever lesions characteristically appear face appearing elsewhere palms hands soles feet centrifugal distribution Threequarters affected people lesions palms soles twothirds mouth third genitals one five lesions eyes They begin small flat spots becoming small bumps fill first clear fluid yellow fluid subsequently burst scab There may lesions several thousand sometimes merging produce large lesions In part body affected lesions evolve stage It looks identical rash smallpox The rash typically lasts around days An affected person may remain unwell two four weeks After healing lesions may leave pale marks becoming dark scars Limited persontoperson spread infection reported diseaseendemic areas Africa Complications include secondary infections pneumonia sepsis encephalitis loss vision severe eye infection If infection occurs pregnancy still birth birth defects may occur The disease may milder people vaccinated smallpox childhood Monkeypox humans animals caused infection monkeypox virus – doublestranded DNA virus genus Orthopoxvirus family Poxviridae The virus found mainly tropical rainforest regions Central West Africa The virus split Congo Basin West African clades matching geographical areas Most human cases monkeypox acquired infected animal though route transmission remains unknown The virus thought enter body broken skin respiratory tract mucous membranes eyes nose mouth Once human infected transmission humans common family members hospital staff particularly high risk infection Humantohuman transmission thought occur primarily close contact infected subject There indications transmission occurs sexual intercourse Animaltohuman transmission may occur bite scratch bush meat preparation direct contact body fluids lesion material indirect contact lesion material contaminated bedding Humans infected animal via bite direct contact infected animals bodily fluids The virus also spread human human respiratory airborne contact contact infected persons bodily fluids Risk factors transmission include sharing bed room using utensils infected person Increased transmission risk associated factors involving introduction virus oral mucosa Monkeypox symptoms tend begin days infection Further research transmission strain responsible outbreak ongoing thought different strains West African clade In addition monkeys virus found Gambian pouched rats Cricetomys gambianus dormice Graphiurus spp African squirrels Heliosciurus Funisciurus The use animals food may important source transmission humans No specific reservoir monkeypox found Monkeys main reservoir contrary name It believed African rodents ones listed serve actual reservoir Clinical differential diagnosis must consider rash illnesses chickenpox measles bacterial skin infections scabies syphilis medicationassociated allergies Lymphadenopathy prodromal stage illness distinguish monkeypox chickenpox smallpox Diagnosis verified testing virus Polymerase chain reaction PCR testing samples skin lesions preferred laboratory test PCR blood tests usually inconclusive virus remain long blood To interpret test results information required date onset fever date onset rash date specimen collection current stage rash patient age Vaccination smallpox assumed provide protection human monkeypox infection closely related viruses vaccine protects animals experimental lethal monkeypox challenges This conclusively demonstrated humans routine smallpox vaccination discontinued following eradication smallpox Smallpox vaccine reported reduce risk monkeypox among previously vaccinated persons Africa The decrease immunity poxviruses exposed populations factor prevalence monkeypox It attributed waning crossprotective immunity among vaccinated mass smallpox vaccinations discontinued gradually increasing proportion unvaccinated individuals The United States Centers Disease Control Prevention CDC recommends persons investigating monkeypox outbreaks involved caring infected individuals animals receive smallpox vaccination protect monkeypox Persons close intimate contact individuals animals confirmed monkeypox also vaccinated The CDC recommend preexposure vaccination unexposed veterinarians veterinary staff animal control officers unless persons involved field investigations The CDC recommends healthcare providers full set personal protective equipment PPE caring infected person This includes gown mask goggles filtering disposable respirator N An infected person isolated preferably negative air pressure room least private exam room keep others possible contact In European Union United States tecovirimat approved treatment several poxviruses including monkeypox BMJ Best Practice recommends tecovirimat smallpox treatment brincidofovir first line antiviral treatment required alongside supportive care including antipyretic fluid balance oxygenation Empirical antibiotic therapy aciclovir may used secondary bacterial varicella zoster infection suspected respectively Monkeypox disease humans first associated illness Democratic Republic Congo formerly Zaire town Basankusu Équateur Province WHO surveillance DRCZaire recorded confirmed cases deaths CFR A second outbreak human illness identified DRCZaire – cases reported DRCZaire The Congo Basin clade disease remains endemic DRC high CFR The genetic clade MPXV occurs Western Africa The case fatality rate CFR less No humantohuman transmission documented monkeypox outbreak Europe The West African clade outbreak – first outbreak monkeypox outside Africa – Midwestern United States among owners pet prairie dogs Seventyone people reportedly infected none died Monkeypox traditionally restricted ecology tropical rainforests The pattern broken cases reported Sudan areas South Sudan fatalities The genetic analysis suggests virus originate Sudan imported likely DRC Many monkeypox cases reported Central West Africa Democratic Republic Congo particular cases per year known The collected data often incomplete unconfirmed hinders realistic estimations number cases monkeypox time Nevertheless suggested number reported monkeypox cases increased geographical occurrence broadened In May young child became ill fever rash bitten prairie dog purchased local swap meet near Milwaukee Wisconsin In total cases monkeypox reported June All cases traced Gambian pouched rats imported Accra Ghana April Texas exotic animal distributor No deaths resulted Electron microscopy serologic studies used confirm disease human monkeypox People monkeypox typically experienced prodromal symptoms fever headaches muscle aches chills drenching sweats Roughly onethird infected people nonproductive coughs This prodromal phase followed – days later development papular rash typically progressed stages vesiculation pustulation umbilication crusting In people early lesions become ulcerated Rash distribution lesions occurred head trunk extremities Many people initial satellite lesions palms soles extremities Rashes generalized people After onset rash people generally manifested rash lesions different stages Everyone affected reported direct close contact prairie dogs later found infected monkeypox virus Monkeypox reportedly spread around southeast south Nigeria Some states federal government Nigeria currently seeking way contain well find cure infected ones It spread Akwa Ibom Abia Bayelsa Benue Cross River Delta Edo Ekiti Enugu Imo Lagos Nasarawa Oyo Plateau Rivers Federal Capital Territory The outbreak started September remained ongoing across multiple states May According information provided Nigeria Centre Disease Control human Monkeypox infections reported country In September human monkeypox reemerged Nigeria years last reported The human monkeypox outbreak country large Bayelsa state first state Nigeria reported outbreak Unlike previous reports West African clade outbreak characterized infection predominantly among young male adults significant transmission others The Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital reported substantial number young adult cases concomitant genital ulcers syphilis HIV infection The CDC reported cases American travelers contracting Monkeypox upon return Lagos Ibadan Agam Rao medical officer Division Pathogens High Consequence Pathology Centers Disease Control Prevention said since cases reported outside Africa come Nigeria In article published The Conversation Oyewale Tomori pointed number Monkeypox infections Nigeria likely underrepresented much Nigerian population avoiding healthcare facilities due fear contracting COVID As British health authorities reported first case Monkeypox UK May Nigerian government released public information statistics reported cases deaths country In report released May NCDC states cases confirmed across states Federal Capital Territory In NCDC implemented National Technical Working Group abbreviated NTWG purpose reporting monitoring infections addition strengthening response capacity In NCDC report Rivers State affected Monkeypox followed Bayelsa Lagos In span NCDC reported deaths different states making Case Fatality Ratio In September United Kingdoms first case monkeypox recorded The person Nigerian national believed contracted monkeypox Nigeria travelling United Kingdom According Public Health England person staying naval base Cornwall moved Royal Free Hospitals specialised infectious disease unit People contact person since contracted disease contacted A second case confirmed town Blackpool case medical worker cared case Blackpool A fourth case occurred December monkeypox diagnosed person south west England They travelling UK Nigeria On May yearold man travelled Nigeria hospitalised isolation ward National Centre Infectious Diseases Singapore confirmed countrys first case monkeypox As result people quarantined The case may linked simultaneous outbreak Nigeria On May UK three cases monkeypox single household identified Public Health Wales The cases also announced Health Secretary Matt Hancock addressing MPs The index case diagnosed May traveling Nigeria The second case reported June third June One three patients adult female treated tecovirimat On day tecovirimat discharged hospital complete second week treatment home On July US American returning trip Nigeria diagnosed monkeypox Subsequent testing identified virus belonging West African clade The patient hospitalized treated tecovirimat discharged days time monkeypox virus DNA could longer detected residual skin lesions An ongoing outbreak monkeypox confirmed May beginning cluster cases found United Kingdom The first recognised case confirmed May individual travel links Nigeria disease endemic suggested cases already spreading Europe previous months From May onwards cases reported increasing number countries regions predominantly Europe also North South America Asia North Africa Australia cases confirmed June Monkeypox first identified laboratory cynomolgus monkeys Denmark Preben von Magnus two outbreaks smallpoxlike disease occurred colonies monkeys captured Malaysia transported via Singapore An outbreak monkeypox Rotterdam Zoo reported Subsequently monkeypox detected several laboratory monkeys US No cases laboratory monkeys occurred conditions monkeys improved requirement monkeys used mainly producing polio vaccine Asia Africa fell The virus never found Asia occurrence Asian monkeys likely due contracting disease captivity transit contamination The first documented case humans unvaccinated month old boy Équateur Province Democratic Republic Congo formerly Zaire Almost cases reported two thirds Zaire The cases originated Liberia Nigeria Ivory Coast Sierra Leone By cases humans reported Small viral outbreaks death rate range secondary humantohuman infection rate amount occur routinely equatorial Central West Africa Signs symptoms animals vary among different species Monkeypox infected Gambian pouched rats may mild symptoms During US outbreak affected prairie dogs presented fever cough sore eyes poor feeding rash Nonhuman primates present similarly They may breathing problems facial swelling mouth ulcers swollen glands In cynomolgus monkeys time exposure symptoms noted around week Rabbits rodents typically present fever cough runny nose sore eyes swollen glands They develop small bumps fill yellow fluid may patches hair loss pneumonia The disease also reported dormice tree squirrels rope squirrels Other animals likely susceptible known Spread among animals occurs via fecaloral route nose wounds eating infected meat Death likely baby monkeys The CDC recommend animals exposed monkeypox quarantined six weeks
