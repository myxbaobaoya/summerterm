Rothia dentocariosa species Grampositive, round rodshaped bacteria part normal community microbes residing mouth respiratory tract. First isolated dental caries, Rothia dentocariosa largely benign, rarely cause disease. The common Rothia infection endocarditis, typically people underlying heart valve disorders. Literature case reports show tissues rarely infected include peritoneum, tonsils, lung, cornea, inner layers eye Endophthalmitis brain intercranial tissues. It implicated periodontal disease, one hypothesis Rothia periodontal disease, dental procedures turn, may first steps infection tissues. A study regarding relationship COVID bacterial communities found Rothia dentocariosa highly predictive COVID. In hospital, samples COVID patients rooms collected, tested COVID, also characterized microbial communities. Found greatest prevalence positive COVID samples Rothia dentocariosa. One case reports fatal Rothia dentocariosa infection fetus utero. Another reports bacterium responsible septic arthritis knee person treated etanercept rheumatoid arthritis. Like Rothia infections reported literature, cause infection identified, responded fully treatment antibiotics. Rothia infections may treated penicillins, erythromycin, cefazolin, rifampin, aminoglycoside, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. Variable pleomorphic shape similar Actinomyces Nocardia, Rothia defined genus . Rothia dentocariosa, like several species oral bacteria, able reduce nitrate nitrite, one study found isolates nitratereducing bacteria mouth.
