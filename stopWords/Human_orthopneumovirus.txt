cases It usually presents days runny nose congestion followed worsening cough noisy breathing tachypnea fast breathing wheezing As infants work harder breathe also show signs respiratory distress subcostal retractions belly pulls ribcage intercostal retractions muscles ribs pull inward grunting nasal flaring If child able feed adequately signs dehydration may also present Fever may present highgrade fever uncommon Crackles wheezing often heard auscultation oxygen saturation levels may decreased In young infants weeks age particularly premature infants signs infection may less specific They may minimal respiratory involvement Instead may exhibit decreased activity irritability poor feeding breathing difficulties This also accompanied apneic spells brief pauses breathing Reinfection RSV remains common throughout life Reinfection adulthood often produces mild moderate symptoms indistinguishable common cold sinus infection Infection may also asymptomatic If present symptoms generally isolated upper respiratory tract runny nose sore throat fever malaise In vast majority cases nasal congestion precedes development cough In contrast upper respiratory infections RSV also likely cause new onset wheeze adults Only infected adults progress significant lower respiratory tract infection bronchitis tracheobronchitis While RSV rarely causes severe disease healthy adults cause significant morbidity mortality elderly underlying immune compromise cardiopulmonary disease Older adults similar presentation younger adults tend greater symptom severity increased risk lower

RSV negativesense singlestranded RNA virus The scientific name viral species Human orthopneumovirus This synonymous Human respiratory syncytial virus hRSV often shortened RSV It belongs genus Orthopneumovirus family Pneumoviridae order Mononegavirales Its name comes fact F proteins surface virus cause neighboring cell membranes merge creating large multinucleated syncytia RSV divided two antigenic subtypes A B based reactivity F G surface proteins monoclonal antibodies The subtypes tend circulate simultaneously within local epidemics although subtype A tends prevalent Generally RSV subtype A RSVA thought virulent RSV subtype B RSVB higher viral loads faster transmission time To date RSVA RSVB clades strains identified Among RSVA GA GA GA GA clades predominate GA found United States Among RSVB BA clade predominates worldwide RSV negativesense singlestranded RNA genome The genome linear approximately nucleotides length It nonsegmented means unlike influenza RSV cannot

infected person coughs sneezes releasing contaminated droplets air Transmission usually occurs droplets come contact another persons eyes nose mouth RSV also live minutes contaminated skin ie hands several hours surfaces like countertops doorknobs It incubation period days Once infected people usually contagious days In infants people weakened immune systems however virus may continue spread weeks even longer showing symptoms Following transmission nose eyes RSV infects ciliated columnar epithelial cells upper lower airway RSV continues replicate within bronchial cells days After first several days RSVinfected cells become rounded ultimately slough smaller bronchioles lower airway This sloughing mechanism also thought responsible spread virus upper lower respiratory tract Infection causes generalized inflammation within lungs including migration infiltration inflammatory cells monocytes Tcells necrosis epithelial cell wall edema increased mucous production Inflammation cell damage tends patchy rather diffuse Together sloughed epithelial cells mucous plugs accumulated immune cells cause obstruction lower airway A variety laboratory tests available diagnosis RSV infection While American Academy Pediatrics AAP routinely recommend use lab testing diagnosis RSV bronchiolitis treatment largely supportive confirmation RSV infection may warranted highrisk groups result guide clinical decisions Common identification techniques include antigen testing molecular testing viral culture Antigen testing involves detection RSV antigen fragments pieces molecular viral structures usually nasopharyngeal swab aspirate This accomplished either viewing fluorescently labeled antigens microscope direct fluorescence assay DFA using commercially available rapid antigen detection test RADT Overall antigen testing highly sensitive young children – substantially less reliable older children adults less viral shedding Antigen tests also subject higher false positive rates outside peak RSV season summer months In scenarios use either viral culture nucleic acid amplification testing NAAT may aid accurate RSV diagnosiscitation needed Molecular assays nucleic acid amplification tests NAATs enable sensitive detection small amounts virus nasopharyngeal swabs aspirates NAAT assays polymerase chain reaction PCR detect virusspecific genetic material rather viral antigens They sensitivity specificity approaching However tend expensive require complex equipment testing methods making less practical resource limited areas In traditional viral culture sample virus introduced different cell lines allowed replicate studied Benefits technique include ability perform genetic characterization strain typing antiviral susceptibility testing However limited prolonged turnaround time – days making less common patient care common research settings Serology measurement virusspecific antibodies serum frequently used RSV diagnosis The time required body mount significant serologic response demonstrate significant rise antibodies detected serum usually useful guiding patient care Up patients documented RSV infection negative serology results As method generally reserved research surveillance studies Chest xrays findings children RSV bronchiolitis generally nonspecific include perihilar markings patchy hyperinflation atelectasis However American Academy Pediatrics AAP recommend routine imaging children presumed RSV bronchiolitis change clinical outcomes associated increased antibiotic use Chest xray sometimes considered diagnosis bronchiolitis unclear unexpected worsening In adults RSV infection chest films often normal demonstrate nonspecific changes consistent viral pneumonia patchy bilateral infiltrates The differential diagnosis individuals presenting signs symptoms upper lower respiratory tract infection includes viral infections rhinovirus metapneumovirus influenza primary bacterial pneumonia In children inhaled foreign bodies congenital conditions cystic fibrosis asthma also considered The main prevention measure avoid close contact infected individuals In community daycare settings careful hand washing help reduce transmission In hospital settings strict adherence infection control measures help prevent spread RSV highrisk individuals Alcoholbased disinfectants recommended hand decontamination Although currently vaccine RSV passive immunization available prevent RSV infection hospitalization highest risk infants Historically RSVspecific intravenous immunoglobin IVIG used provide passive immunity This involved monthly administration RSVneutralizing antibodies immunoglobins human donors recovering disease While transfer antibodies reasonably effective providing shortterm immunization atrisk infants limited intravenous administration cost RSVIVIG since replaced use monoclonal antibody MAb delivered muscular injection While several monoclonal antibodies developed RSV prophylaxis successful

make infantile immunization difficult Attempts develop RSV vaccine began formalininactivated vaccine developed use infants children While similar method used create safe effective poliovirus vaccine vaccine resulted dangerous phenomenon came known vaccineassociated enhanced respiratory disease VAERD In VAERD vaccinated infants went develop significantly worse respiratory disease nonvaccinated infants subsequent natural infection Some children vs virusexposed controls hospitalized two cases leading death This disaster led extreme caution hindered vaccine development many years A paper claimed research toward vaccine development greatly advanced preceding – years candidates stage development The study predicted vaccine would available within years The types vaccines currently research fall five broad categories liveattenuated protein subunit vectorbased particlebased messenger RNA Each targets different immune responses thus may better suited prevent disease different atrisk groups Liveattenuated vaccines shown success RSVnaive infants Other vaccine candidates hope target vulnerable populations across lifespan including pregnant women elderly Treatment RSV infection focused primarily supportive care This may include monitoring patients breathing using suction remove secretions upper airway Supplemental oxygen may also delivered though nasal cannula face mask order improve airflow In severe cases respiratory failure intubation mechanical ventilation may required support breathing If signs dehydration present fluids may also given orally IV Additional supportive treatments investigated specifically infants hospitalized RSV bronchiolitis These include following Bronchodilators medications commonly used treat asthma sometimes used treat wheezing associated RSV infection These medications albuterol salbutamol betaagonists relax muscles airways allow improved airflow However bronchodilators found improve clinical severity infection rate hospitalization among RSV infection Given limited benefit plus adverse event profile routinely recommended use RSV bronchiolitis Antibiotic therapy appropriate treatment RSVrelated bronchiolitis viral pneumonia Antibiotics target bacterial pathogens viral pathogens RSV However antibiotics may considered clear evidence secondary bacterial infection developed Ear infections may also develop small number infants RSV bronchiolitis case oral antibiotics may sometimes used Worldwide RSV leading cause bronchiolitis pneumonia infants children age The risk serious infection highest first months life Of infected RSV – develop bronchiolitis necessitating hospitalization Each year approximately million acute respiratory illnesses childhood deaths caused RSV worldwide An estimated infants experienced RSV infection age months nearly children infected years In United States RSV responsible acute respiratory infection hospitalizations children age However vast majority RSVrelated deaths occur lowincome countries lack access basic supportive care It rare healthy young adults develop severe illness requiring hospitalization RSV However recognized significant cause morbidity mortality certain adult populations including elderly underlying heart lung diseases Its clinical impact among elderly adults estimated similar influenza Each year approximately nursing home residents experience RSV infection significant rates pneumonia death RSV also responsible adult communityacquired pneumonias In adults children immunosuppression increases susceptibility RSV infection Children living HIV likely develop acute illness times likely require hospitalization children without HIV Bone marrow transplant patients prior marrow engraftment particularly high risk RSV accounting nearly half viral infections population This group also demonstrated mortality rates among RSV pneumonia While infection may occur within community hospitalacquired infection thought account cases among immunocompromised individuals RSV seasonality varies around world In temperate climates infection rates tend highest cold winter months This often attributed increased indoor crowding increased viral stability lower temperatures In tropical arctic climates however annual variation less well defined seems prevalent rainy season Annual epidemics generally caused presence several different viral strains Subtype A B viruses often circulate simultaneously within specific geographic region although group A viruses prevalent The COVID pandemic resulted significant decline prevalence RSV There significant unseasonal rebound lockdowns restrictive measures relaxed RSV first discovered researchers isolated virus population chimpanzees respiratory illness They named virus CCA Chimpanzee Coryza
