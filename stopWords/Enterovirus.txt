studies distinguished human enterovirus serotypes basis antibody neutralization tests Additional antigenic variants defined within several serotypes basis reduced nonreciprocal crossneutralization variant strains On basis pathogenesis humans animals enteroviruses originally classified four groups polioviruses Coxsackie A viruses CA Coxsackie B viruses CB echoviruses quickly realized significant overlaps biological properties viruses different groups Enteroviruses isolated recently named system consecutive numbers EVD EVB EVD EVA etc genotyping based VP capsid region Enteroviruses affect millions people worldwide year often found respiratory secretions eg saliva sputum nasal mucus stool infected person Historically poliomyelitis significant disease caused enterovirus namely poliovirus There nonpolio polio enteroviruses cause disease humans Of nonpolio types Coxsackie A viruses Coxsackie B viruses echoviruses enteroviruses Poliovirus well coxsackie echovirus spread fecaloral route Infection result wide variety symptoms including mild respiratory illness common cold hand foot mouth disease acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis aseptic meningitis myocarditis severe neonatal sepsislike disease acute flaccid paralysis related acute flaccid myelitis Enteroviruses members picornavirus family large diverse group small RNA viruses characterized single positivestrand genomic RNA All enteroviruses contain genome approximately bases known high mutation rate due lowfidelity replication frequent recombination After infection host cell genome translated capindependent manner single polyprotein subsequently processed virusencoded proteases structural capsid proteins nonstructural proteins mainly involved replication virus RNA recombination appears major driving force evolution enteroviruses well shaping genetic architecture The mechanism recombination RNA genome likely involves template strand switching RNA replication process known copy choice recombination RNA recombination considered adaptation dealing RNA genome damage source genetic diversity It also source concern vaccination strategies live attenuatedmutated strains used vaccination could potentially recombine wildtype related strains case circulating vaccine derived polio viruses cVDPDs The capsid region especially VP recombination coldspot one main reasons use region genotyping However UTR capsid junction beginning P region observed recombine frequently although recombinations occur rest genome well Interestingly enterovirus species EVA EVB EVC EVD observed far exchange genomic regions among exception UTR Enteroviruses group ubiquitous viruses cause number infections usually mild The genus picornavirus includes enteroviruses rhinoviruses Enterovirus A include coxsackievirus A A A A A A A A A A A enterovirus A A A A A A A A A A A A simian virus A simian virus A simian virus A baboon enterovirus A Some viruses initially reported novel found misidentified Thus coxsackievirus A serotype echovirus coxsackievirus A serotype coxsackievirus A coxsackievirus A serotype coxsackievirus ACoxsackie A virus causes human hand foot mouth disease Enterovirus B includes coxsackievirus B coxsackievirus A echovirus enterovirus B Coxsackie B viruses found worldwide cause myocarditis inflammation heart pericarditis inflammation sac surrounding heart meningitis inflammation membranes line brain spinal cord pancreatitis inflammation pancreas The Coxsackie B viruses also reported cause spastic paralysis due degeneration neuronal tissue muscle injury Infections usually occur warm summer months symptoms including exanthema pleurodynia flulike illness consisting fever fatigue malaise myalgia nausea abdominal pain vomiting Echoviruses cause many nonspecific viral infections range minor illness severe potentially fatal conditions aseptic meningitis encephalitis paralysis myocarditis It mainly found intestine cause nervous disorders Type B enteroviruses responsible vast number mild acute infections They reported remain body causing persistent infections contributing chronic diseases type I diabetes Enterovirus C consists polioviruses coxsackieviruses A A A A A A A A enterovirus C C C C C C C C C The three serotypes poliovirus PV PV PV slightly different capsid protein Capsid proteins define cellular receptor specificity virus antigenicity PV common type cause infection humans however three forms extremely contagious spreading persontoperson contact Poliovirus causes Polio Poliomyelitis disabling lifethreatening disease causes paresthesia meningitis permanent paralysis Symptoms include sore throat fever tiredness nausea headache stomach pain although get infected display visible symptoms There two types vaccines available prevent polio inactivated poliovirus vaccine given injection leg IPV arm oral poliovirus vaccine OPV The polio vaccine highly efficacious giving protection children vaccinated Enteroviruses usually capable producing acute infections rapidly cleared adaptive immune response However genome mutations enterovirus B serotypes may acquire host acute phase may transform viruses noncytolytic form also known noncytopathic defective enterovirus This mutated quasispecies enterovirus cause persistent infection human cardiac tissues especially patients myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy In persistent infections viral RNA present low levels believed contribute ongoing myocardial disease fading remnant recent acute infection although scientists think otherwise EVD first identified California Compared enteroviruses rarely reported US past years Most people get infected infants children teens EVD usually causes mild severe respiratory illness however full spectrum EVD illness welldefined Most start common cold symptoms runny nose cough Some may also fever For severe cases difficulty breathing wheezing problems catching breath may occur As October one death New Jersey directly linked EVD well one death Rhode Islandcitation needed attributed combination EVD sepsis caused infection staphylococcus aureus Enterovirus A EVA notable one major causative agents hand foot mouth disease HFMD sometimes associated severe central nervous system diseases EVA first isolated characterized cases neurological disease California To date little known molecular mechanisms host response EVA infection increases level mRNAs encoding chemokines proteins involved protein degradation complement proteins proapoptotis proteins implicated There three serotypes poliovirus PV PV PV slightly different capsid protein Capsid
