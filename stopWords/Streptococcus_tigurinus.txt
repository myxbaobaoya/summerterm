Streptococcus tigurinus novel member genus Streptococcus first discovered Swedish researchers. Streptococcus tigrinus member Grampositive bacteria family Streptococcaceae identifiable S ribosomal RNA gene analysis. S. tigurinus initially difficult study due similarity bacteria causing go unnoticed,citation needed recently identified structurally related Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus intermedius . Streptococcus tigurinus generally normal part human bacteria flora currently unknown natural habitat potential colonization. Capable causing serious infections manages enter body's bloodstream, usually open wounds mouth, first discovered cause invasive infections isolated patient infective endocarditis.citation needed It later detected blood cerebrospinal fluid patients varying types serious invasive infections spondylodiscitis, bacteremia, meningitis, empyema. As S. tigurinus relatively rare, scientists still researching effective ways combat bacterium, strains showing resistance drugs like tetracycline enhanced resistance phagocytosis macrophages.
