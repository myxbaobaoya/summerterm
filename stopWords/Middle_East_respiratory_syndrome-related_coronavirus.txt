Middle East respiratory syndromeâ€“related coronavirus MERSCoV EMC HCoVEMC virus causes Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS It species coronavirus infects humans bats camels The infecting virus enveloped positivesense singlestranded RNA virus enters host cell binding DPP receptor The species member genus Betacoronavirus subgenus Merbecovirus Initially called simply novel coronavirus nCoV first reported June genome sequencing virus isolated sputum samples person fell ill outbreak new flulike respiratory illness By July MERSCoV cases reported countries Europe North America Asia well Middle East MERSCoV one several viruses identified World Health Organization WHO likely cause future epidemic They list urgent research development The virus MERSCoV member beta group coronavirus Betacoronavirus lineage C MERSCoV genomes phylogenetically classified two clades clade A B The earliest cases clade A clusters majority recent cases genetically distinct clade B MERSCoV one seven known coronaviruses infect humans including HCoVE HCoVNL HCoVOC HCoVHKU original SARSCoV SARSCoV SARSCoV It frequently referred SARSlike virus By November cases MERS reported deaths implying case fatality rate greater The first confirmed case reported Jeddah Saudi Arabia April Egyptian virologist Ali Mohamed Zaki isolated identified previously unknown coronavirus mans lungs Zaki posted findings September ProMEDmail The isolated cells showed cytopathic effects CPE form rounding syncytia formation A second case found September yearold man living Qatar presented similar flu symptoms A sequence virus nearly identical first case In November similar cases appeared Qatar Saudi Arabia Additional cases noted deaths associated rapid research monitoring novel coronavirus began It known whether infections result single zoonotic event subsequent humantohuman transmission multiple geographic sites infection represent multiple zoonotic events unknown common sourcecitation needed A study Ziad Memish Riyadh University colleagues suggests virus arose time July June perhaps many seven separate zoonotic transmissionscitation needed Among animal reservoirs CoV large genetic diversity yet samples patients suggested similar genome therefore common source though data limited It determined molecular clock analysis viruses EMC EnglandQatar date early suggesting cases descended single zoonotic event It appeared MERSCoV circulating human population year without detection suggested independent transmission unknown source In humans virus strong tropism nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells shown effectively evade innate immune responses antagonize interferon IFN production cells This tropism unique respiratory viruses target ciliated cells Due clinical similarity MERSCoV SARSCoV proposed may use cellular receptor exopeptidase angiotensin converting enzyme ACE However later discovered neutralization ACE recombinant antibodies prevent MERSCoV infection Further research identified dipeptidyl peptidase DPP also known CD functional cellular receptor MERSCoV Unlike known coronavirus receptors enzymatic activity DPP required infection As would expected amino acid sequence DPP highly conserved across species expressed human bronchial epithelium kidneys Bat DPP genes appear subject high degree adaptive evolution response coronavirus infections lineage leading MERSCoV may circulated bat populations long period time transmitted people On February World Health Organization stated "the risk sustained persontoperson transmission appears low" The cells MERSCoV infects lungs account respiratory epithelial cells large number virions likely needed inhaled cause infection Anthony Fauci National Institutes Health Bethesda Maryland stated MERSCoV "does spread sustained person person way all" noting possibility virus could mutate strain transmit person person However infection healthcare workers led concerns human human transmission The Centers Disease Control Prevention CDC list MERS transmissible human human They state "MERSCoV shown spread people close contact Transmission infected patients healthcare personnel also observed Clusters cases several countries investigated" However th May CDC revealed Illinois man originally thought first incidence persontoperson spread Indiana man business meeting fact tested negative MERSCoV After completing additional definitive tests using neutralising antibody assay experts CDC concluded Indiana patient spread virus Illinois patient Tests concluded Illinois man previously infected It possible MERS symptomless early research shown cases show signs active infection MERSCoV antibodies blood The virus appears originated bats The virus isolated bat This virus closely related Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU Serological evidence shows viruses infected camels least years The recent common ancestor several human strains dated March confidence interval December June It thought viruses present bats time spread camels mids The viruses appear spread camels humans early The original bat host species time initial infection species yet determinedcitation needed Examination sequences isolates suggested virus evolved three clades differing codon usage host geographic distribution It believed virus originated bats one candidate Egyptian tomb bat Work epidemiologist Ian Lipkin Columbia University New York showed virus isolated bat looked match virus found humans c betacoronaviruses detected Nycteris bats Ghana Pipistrellus bats Europe phylogenetically related MERSCoV virus However major natural reservoir humans get virus infection remained unknown August report journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases showed blood serum Omani camels Spanish camels proteinspecific antibodies MERSCoV spike protein Blood serum European sheep goats cattle camelids antibodies Soon September seroepidemiological study published journal Eurosurveillance RA Perera et al investigated human animal sera indicated abundant presence MERSCoV specific antibody Egyptian dromedary camels animals goats cows sheep region These first significant scientific reports indicated role "dromedary camels" reservoir MERSCoV Research linked camels showing coronavirus infection dromedary camel calves adults match genomes human clade B MERSCoV At least one person fallen sick MERS known come contact camels recently drank camel milk Countries like Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates produce consume large amounts camel meat The possibility exists African Australian bats harbor virus transmit camels Imported camels regions might carried virus Middle East In MERSCoV identified three members dromedary camel herd held Qatar barn linked two confirmed human cases since recovered The presence MERSCoV camels confirmed National Institute Public Health Environment RIVM Ministry Health Erasmus Medical Center WHO Collaborating Center Netherlands None camels showed sign disease samples collected The Qatar Supreme Council Health advised November people underlying health conditions heart disease diabetes kidney disease respiratory disease immunosuppressed elderly avoid close animal contacts visiting farms markets practice good hygiene washing hands A study dromedary camels Saudi Arabia published December revealed presence MERSCoV evaluated dromedary camels suggesting dromedary camels could main reservoir MERSCoV also animal source MERS According March MERSCoV summary update recent studies support camels serve primary source MERSCoV infecting humans bats may ultimate reservoir virus Evidence includes frequency virus found camels human cases exposed seriological data shows widespread transmission camels similarity camel CoV human CoV On June Arab News newspaper highlighted latest research findings New England Journal Medicine yearold Saudi man kept herd nine camels died MERS November His friends said witnessed applying topical medicine nose one ill camelsfour reportedly sick nasal dischargeseven days became stricken MERS Researchers sequenced virus found one sick camels virus killed man found genomes identical In article Arab News reported June cases MERS reported within Kingdom Saudi Arabia deaths MERSCoV closely related bat coronaviruses HKU HKU lineage C SARSCoV lineage B sharing sequence identity closest
