Eastern equine encephalitis EEE commonly called Triple E sleeping sickness confused African trypanosomiasis disease caused zoonotic mosquito vectored Togavirus present North Central South America Caribbean EEE first recognized Massachusetts United States horses died mysteriously viral encephalitis Epizootics horses continued occur regularly United States It also identified donkeys zebras Due rarity disease occurrence cause economic impact beyond cost horses poultry EEE found today eastern part United States often associated coastal plains It commonly found East Coast Gulf Coast states In Florida one two human cases reported year although cases equine encephalitis reported In years conditions favorable disease number equine cases Diagnosing equine encephalitis challenging many symptoms shared illnesses patients asymptomatic Confirmations may require sample cerebral spinal fluid brain tissue although CT scans MRI scans used detect encephalitis This could indication need test EEE necessary If biopsy cerebral spinal fluid taken sent specialized laboratory testing Eastern equine encephalitis virus EEEV closely related Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus western equine encephalitis virus The incubation period Eastern equine encephalitis virus EEEV disease ranges days The illness progress either systematically encephalitically depending persons age Encephalitic disease involves swelling brain asymptomatic systemic illness occurs abruptly Those systemic illness usually recover within – weeks While encephalitis common among infants adults children usually manifests experiencing systemic illness Symptoms include high fever muscle pain altered mental status headache meningeal irritation photophobia seizures occur – days bite infected mosquito Due viruss effect brain patients survive left mental physical impairments personality disorders paralysis seizures intellectual impairment The causative agent later identified togavirus first isolated infected horse brains In first confirmed human cases identified children died encephalitis Northeastern United States These cases coincided outbreaks horses regions The fatality rate humans currently cure known human infections This virus four variations types lineage The common human disease group considered endemic North America Caribbean three lineages groups IIA IIB III typically found Central South America causing equine illness These two clades may actually distinct viruses The North American strains appear monotypic mutation rate × − substitutionssiteyear ssy It appears diverged strains years ago The strains divided two main clades third smaller one The two main clades diverged years ago The mutation rate genome estimated × − ssycitation needed EEEV capable infecting wide range animals including mammals birds reptiles amphibians The virus maintained nature birdmosquito cycle Two mosquito species primarily involved portion cycle Culiseta melanura Culiseta morsitans Wikidata These mosquitoes feed blood birds The frequency virus found nature increases throughout summer birds mosquitoes become infectedcitation needed Transmission EEEV mammals including humans occurs via mosquito species feed blood birds mammals These mosquitoes referred "bridge vectors" carry virus avian hosts types hosts particularly mammals The bridge vectors include Aedes taeniorhynchus Aedes vexans Coquillettidia perturbans Ochlerotatus canadensis Ochlerotatus sollicitans Ochlerotatus canadensis also frequently bites turtles Humans horses infected mammals circulate enough viruses blood infect additional mosquitoes Some cases EEE contracted laboratory exposures exposure eyes lungs skin wounds brain spinal cord matter infected animalscitation needed The disease prevented horses use vaccinations usually given vaccinations diseases commonly western equine encephalitis virus Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus tetanus Most vaccinations EEE consist killed virus For humans vaccine EEE available prevention involves reducing risk exposure Using insect repellent wearing protective clothing reducing amount standing water best means prevention No cure EEE found Treatment consists corticosteroids anticonvulsants supportive measures treating symptoms intravenous fluids tracheal intubation antipyreticscitation needed About humans known infected develop symptoms total six cases per year US A third cases die many survivors suffer permanent brain damage Several states Northeast US increased virus activity since Between least ten human cases EEE reported Massachusetts In acres km southeastern Massachusetts treated mosquito adulticides reduce risk humans contracting EEE Several human cases reported New Hampshire well On July virus identified mosquito species Coquillettidia perturbans Nickerson State Park Cape Cod Massachusetts On July virus found mosquitos Pittsfield Massachusetts As September update notable uptick cases erupted New England Michigan prompting health departments declare outbreak As October update five people died Michigan three people died Connecticut one person died Rhode Island one person died Alabama one person died Indiana three people died Massachusetts The virus also found goats turkeys deer horses As September confirmed human cases Massachusetts Wisconsin As October one person died Michigan one person died Wisconsin In October citizen Livingston West Lothian Scotland became first European victim disease The man visited New Hampshire summer fishing vacation diagnosed EEE September He fell ill disease August one day flying home later fell coma He later awoke coma severe brain injuries EEEV one dozen agents United States researched potential biological weapons nation suspended biologicalweapons program years signing ratifying Biological Weapons Convention After inoculation vector virus travels via lymphatics lymph nodes replicates macrophages neutrophils resulting lymphopenia leukopenia fever Subsequent replication occurs organs leading viremia Symptoms horses occur – weeks infection begin fever may reach high °F °C The fever usually lasts – hoursmedical citation needed Nervous signs appear fever include sensitivity sound periods excitement restlessness Brain lesions appear causing drowsiness drooping ears circling aimless wandering head pressing inability swallow abnormal gait Paralysis follows causing horse difficulty raising head The horse usually suffers complete paralysis death – days symptoms appear Mortality rates among horses eastern strain range medical citation needed
