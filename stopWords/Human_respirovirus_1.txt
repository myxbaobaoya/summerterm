Human parainfluenza viruses HPIVs viruses cause human parainfluenza HPIVs paraphyletic group four distinct singlestranded RNA viruses belonging Paramyxoviridae family These viruses closely associated human veterinary disease Virions approximately – nm size contain negative sense RNA genome encompassing nucleotides The viruses detected via cell culture immunofluorescent microscopy PCR HPIVs remain second main cause hospitalisation children years age suffering respiratory illness Respiratory syncytial virus RSV causes respiratory hospitalisations age group The first HPIV discovered late The taxonomic division broadly based antigenic genetic characteristics forming four major serotypes clades today considered distinct viruses These include HPIVs belong two genera Respirovirus HPIV HPIV Rubulavirus HPIV HPIV HPIVs characterised producing enveloped virions containing single stranded negative sense RNA Noninfectious virions also reported contain RNA positive polarity HPIV genomes nucleotides length encode six key structural proteins The structural gene sequence HPIVs follows ′NPPMFHNL′ protein prefixes details outlined table With advent reverse genetics found efficient human parainfluenza viruses terms replication transcription genome nucleotide total divisible number This led "rule six" coined Exceptions rule found exact advantages fully understood Electrophoresis shown molecular weight MW proteins four HPIVs similar exception phosphoprotein shows significant variation Viral replication initiated successful entry cell attachment fusion virus host cell lipid membrane Viral RNA vRNA initially associated nucleoprotein NP phosphoprotein P large protein L The hemagglutinin–neuraminidase HN involved viral attachment thus hemadsorption hemagglutination Furthermore fusion F protein important aiding fusion host viral cellular membranes eventually forming syncytia Initially F protein inactive form F cleaved proteolysis form active form F F linked disulphide bonds Once complete followed HPIV nucleocapsid entering cytoplasm cell Subsequently genomic transcription occurs using viruses viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase L protein The cells ribosomes tasked translation forming viral proteins viral mRNA Towards end process formation viral proteins replication viral genome occurs Initially occurs formation positivesense RNA intermediate step necessary producing progeny finally negativesense RNA formed associated nucleoprotein This may either packaged released cell budding used subsequent rounds transcription replication The observable morphological changes seen infected cells include enlargement cytoplasm decreased mitotic activity focal rounding potential formation multinucleate cells syncytia The pathogenicity HPIVs mutually dependent viruses correct accessory proteins able elicit antiinterferon properties This major factor clinical significance disease The main host remains human However infections induced animals natural experimental situations although always asymptomatic It estimated million children lower respiratory infections LRI year United States alone HPIV HPIV HPIV linked third infections Upper respiratory infections URI also important context HPIV however caused lesser extent virus The highest rates serious HPIV illnesses occur among young children surveys shown children aged older antibodies HPIV For infants young children estimated develop "clinically significant disease" Repeated infection throughout life host uncommon symptoms later breakouts include upper respiratory tract illness cold sore throat The incubation period four serotypes days In immunosuppressed people parainfluenza virus infections cause severe pneumonia fatal HPIV HPIV demonstrated principal causative agent behind croup laryngotracheobronchitis viral disease upper airway mainly problematic children aged – months age Biennial epidemics starting Autumn associated HPIV however HPIV also yearly outbreaks Additionally HPIV tends cause biennial outbreaks croup Fall In United States large peaks presently occurring oddnumbered years HPIV closely associated bronchiolitis pneumonia principally targets aged year HPIV remains infrequently detected However believed common previously thought less likely cause severe disease By age majority children seropositive HPIV infection may indicative large proportion asymptomatic mild infections Important epidemiological factors associated higher risk infection mortality immunocompromised may taken ill extreme forms LRI Associations HPIVs neurologic disease known example hospitalisation certain HPIVs strong association febrile seizures HPIVB strongest association followed HPIV HPIVs also linked rare cases virally caused meningitis Guillain–Barré syndrome HPIVs spread person person horizontal transmission contact infected secretions respiratory droplets contaminated surfaces objects Infection occur infectious material contacts mucous membranes eyes mouth

inflammation airway common attribute HPIV infection It believed occur due large scale upregulation inflammatory cytokines Common cytokines expected upregulated include IFN–α various interleukins IL– IL TNF–α Various chemokines inflammatory proteins also believed associated common symptoms HPIV infection Recent evidence seems suggest virusspecific antibodies IgE may responsible mediating largescale releases histamine trachea believed cause croup More detail pathways interactions found The bodys primary defense HPIV infection remains humoral immunity This mainly directed surface proteins found virus In particular proteins HN F prove immunogenic terms stimulating immune system Recently importance cell mediated immune system scrutinized Reports shown defective adaptive immune responses higher risk severe infection Diagnosis made several ways encompassing range multifaceted techniques Because similarity terms antigenic profile viruses hemagglutination assay HA hemadsorption inhibition HAdI processes often used Both complement fixation neutralisation enzyme linked immunosorbent assays – ELISA also used aid process distinguishing viral serotypes Mortality caused HPIVs developed regions world remains rare Where mortality occurred principally three core risk groups young elderly immunocompromised Long term changes however associated airway remodelling believed significant cause morbidity The exact associations HPIVs diseases chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD still investigated In developing regions world preschool children remain highest mortality risk group Mortality may consequence primary viral infection secondary problems bacterial infection Predispositions malnutrition deficiencies may elevate chances mortality associated infection Overall LRIs cause approximately – total deaths preschool children developing world HPIVs believed associated LRI cases thus remaining significant cause mortality Numerous factors suggested linked higher risk acquiring infection inclusive malnutrition vitamin A deficiency absence breastfeeding early stages life environmental pollution overcrowding Despite decades research vaccines currently exist Recombinant technology however used target formation vaccines HPIV taken form several liveattenuated intranasal vaccines Two vaccines particular found immunogenic well tolerated HPIV phase I trials HPIV vaccine candidates remain less advanced Vaccine techniques used HPIVs limited intranasal forms also viruses attenuated cold passage host range attenuation chimeric construct vaccines also introducing mutations help reverse genetics achieve attenuation Maternal antibodies may offer degree protection HPIVs early stages life via colostrum breast milk Ribavirin one medication shown good potential treatment HPIV given recent invitro tests invivo tests show mixed results Ribavirin broadspectrum antiviral administered severely immunocompromised despite lack conclusive evidence benefit Protein inhibitors novel forms medication also proposed relieve symptoms infection Furthermore antibiotics may used secondary bacterial infection develops Corticosteroid treatment nebulizers also first line choice croup breathing difficulties ensue Parainfluenza viruses last hours environment inactivated soap water Furthermore virus also easily destroyed using common hygiene techniques detergents disinfectants antiseptics Environmental factors important HPIV survival pH humidity temperature medium within virus found The optimal pH around physiologic pH values whilst high temperatures °C low humidity infectivity reduces The majority transmission linked close contact especially nosocomial infections Chronic care facilities doctors surgeries also known transmission hotspots transmission occurring via aerosols large droplets also fomites contaminated surfaces The exact infectious dose remains unknown In economically disadvantaged regions world HPIV infection
