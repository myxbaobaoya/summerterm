Bacteroides dorei species bacteria within genus Bacteroides, first isolated . It found intestinal systems humans animals. Research conducted better understand relationship Bacteroides dorei human intestinal system autoimmune disease, Type Diabetes TD. Bacteroides dorei gram negative, rodshaped bacteria contributes normal intestinal functionality. It isolated differentiated Bacteroides vulgatus using S rRNA sequencing phenotypic tests.

Growth cells seen via production acid occurred following sugars: glucose, sucrose, xylose, rhamnose, lactose, maltose, arabinose, mannose raffinose growth acid production occurred following sugars: cellobiose, salicin, trehalose, mannitol, glycerol, melezitose sorbitol. Previous research shown individuals genetically predisposition various autoimmune diseases significant differences bacteria composition nongenetically predisposition individuals. This difference bacteria composition gut system increasingly believed highly important understanding autoimmune diseases Type Diabetes. In , researchers looked early development bacterial composition high genetic risk children looking early onset Type Diabetes. They took stool samples children looking early development microbial communities – months age . year old. Out infants, seroconverted TD autoimmune related cases, later developed TD cases. The infants seroconvert develop TD control. Metagenomic sequencing results showed significantly higher composition B. dorei Bacteroides vulgatus cases versus control group prior seroconversion. In addition, data showed B. dorei peaked . months, almost months prior first inslet autoantibody cases. This significant compositional change suggests increase amount B. dorei potential indicator development TD. Additional research looked epigenetics B. dorei able demonstrate individual B. dorei GATC gene methylation another individual B. dorei lacking GATC methylation. Scientist took stool samples two babies sequenced genomes B. dorei samples . Sample B. dorei , total methylation genome , methylation sites sample B. dorei , , total methylations , methylation sites. The key result sample includes key gene called DamMT DNA methyltransferase sample lacked gene. In addition, , GATC sites sample B. dorei , sites methylated whereas sample B. dorei , GATC sites none GATC sites methylated. Dam methylation methylation GATC could significant factors microbial colonization functionality gut system affects numerous gene expressions transport processes nutrient transportation, antibiotic effluxes actions antibiotic resistance, movement energy. The results suggests Dam GATC methylation B. dorei could highly significant varied gene expression B. dorei lacks GATC methylation could affect functionality B. dorei gut microbiome. Previous research shown Dam methylation mutants increased susceptibility higher antibiotic concentrations lower minimum. This suggests Dam methylation process plays significant role upregulation antibiotic effluxes, resulting increased antibiotic resistance. Also, GATC methylation demonstrates important microbial functions DNA repair, replication, LPS composition. Methylation GATC motif DamMT pathogenic bacteria, example, Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia pestis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis shown increase virulence expression genes towards multiple operations as, mismatch repair DNA replication enables pathogenic bacteria combat antibiotics. These results show future research create antibiotics prevent creation DamMT pathogenetic bacteria needed.
