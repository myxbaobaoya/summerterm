Veillonella Gramnegative bacteria Gram stain pink anaerobic cocci, unlike Bacillota, Grampositive bacteria. This bacterium well known lactate fermenting abilities. It normal bacterium intestines oral mucosa mammals. In humans implicated cases osteomyelitis endocarditis, example species Veillonella parvula. Veillonella dispar nitratereducing bacterium oral cavity, beneficially antibacterial. Lactate fermented propionate acetate methylmalonylCoA pathway. Little ATP produced fermentation. High substrate affinity suggested reason. Lactate → acetate propionate CO HO A study Veillonella endurance athletes found relative abundance bacteria gut associated increased treadmill run time performance. This effect demonstrated due organism's propionate metabolite produced lactic acid.
