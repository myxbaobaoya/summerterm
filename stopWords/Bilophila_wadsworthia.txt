Bilophila wadsworthia gramnegative, obligately anaerobic, catalasepositive, bileresistant, asaccharolytic bacillus. This bacterium . μm wide .–. μm long colony cells pleomorphic irregular cell walls. This bacterial species mostly urease positive; around strains urease positive. Less . human gut microbiota bacterium. B. wadsworthia linked various diseases well known due frequent misidentification bacteria. The two unique characteristics B. wadsworthia utilisation sulfated amino acid taurine production hydrogen sulfide rapid catalase reaction. This bacterium vulnerable antibiotics: imipenem, ceoxitin, ticarcillin, βlactam antibiotics. B. wadsworthia gramnegative, catalasepositive, usually ureasepositive bacterium. Although strains urease positive, strains urease negative. This bacterium, due slow nature grow standard media anaerobes, often misidentified anaerobes identified all. The best identifier bacterium transparent colony black center BBE agar; black center ferrous sulfide, created hydrogen sulfide bacteria produces. Another unique characteristic B. wadsworthia positive catalase reaction hydrogen peroxide reagent; catalase reaction unlike catalasepositive species reaction explosive bubble formation quick. The accurate method identify bacterium similar species gas liquid chromatography GLC; GLC results show lot acetic acid peaks minimal succinic acid present. B. wadsworthia nonmotile nonspore forming. In addition, bacterium irregular cell walls flagella attached it. The two factors stimulate growth bile pyruvate; specifically, bile pyruvate. One main processes occur B. wadsworthia hydrogen sulfide production, product responsible bacterium's signature black dot. B. wadsworthia able produce hydrogen sulfide taurine desulfonation pathway using isethionate sulfitelyase IslA. The bacterium converts taurine hydrogen sulfide respires taurine. The production hydrogen sulfide connected human intestinal microbiota; although benefits hydrogen sulfide production gut like cardioprotection, hydrogen sulfide production also contributes disease pathology. Production hydrogen sulfide linked irritable bowel disease IBD damaging gut epithelium's mucus layer colorectal cancer. In addition, treatments antibiotics, hydrogen sulfide aide opportunistic bacteria grow leading antibiotic resistance. Future research controlling hydrogen sulfide production may help address B. wadsworthia's contribution diseases. The bacteria must grown agar least days order see colony formation. Starting day , two possible types colonies appear. First, mm diameter convex irregular colony black center visible. Second, translucent umbonate circular colony dark center present. In addition, βlactamase produced agar colonies formed BBE agar pass positive urease test. BBE agar optimal agar B. wadsworthia colony growth. The bacteria similar BBE agar must incubated agar least days. In agar, .. mm diameter raised, circular erose colony visible. Also, colony gray translucent. Although preferred location bacterium still unknown, mostly found lower parts gastrointestinal tract. This bacterium considered virulent nature commonly found patients appendicitis, gangrenous appendicitis, blood cultures patients liver abscesses; thirdmost abundant anaerobic bacterium found patients appendicitis. Also, found feces samples healthy patients. In nonhuman cases, bacterium found dogs periodontal disease. In rare cases, bacterium may found saliva vaginal samples. Other specimen locations B. wadsworthia found include: B. wadsworthia first identified Ellen Jo Baron, director Clinical Anaerobic Bacteriology Research Laboratory V.A. Wadsworth Medical Center West Los Angeles VA Medical Center source name. It found specimens collected patients perforated appendicitis gangrenous appendicitis; bacterium also found healthy fecal specimens. This bacterium categorized genus Bilophila bileloving growing nature.
