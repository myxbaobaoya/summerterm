Streptococcus genus grampositive coccus plural cocci spherical bacteria belongs family Streptococcaceae, within order Lactobacillales lactic acid bacteria, phylum Bacillota. Cell division streptococci occurs along single axis, grow, tend form pairs chains may appear bent twisted. This differs staphylococci, divide along multiple axes, thereby generating irregular, grapelike clusters cells. Most streptococci oxidasenegative catalasenegative, many facultative anaerobes capable growth aerobically anaerobically. The term coined Viennese surgeon Albert Theodor Billroth –, combining prefix "strepto" Ancient Greek: στρεπτός, romanized: streptós, lit. 'easily twisted, pliant', together suffix "coccus" Modern Latin: coccus, Ancient Greek: κόκκος, romanized: kókkos, lit. 'grain, seed, berry'. In , many bacteria formerly grouped genus Streptococcus separated genera Enterococcus Lactococcus. Currently, species recognised genus. This genus found part salivary microbiome. In addition streptococcal pharyngitis strep throat, certain Streptococcus species responsible many cases pink eye, meningitis, bacterial pneumonia, endocarditis, erysipelas, necrotizing fasciitis 'flesheating' bacterial infections. However, many streptococcal species pathogenic, form part commensal human microbiota mouth, skin, intestine, upper respiratory tract. Streptococci also necessary ingredient producing Emmentaler "Swiss" cheese.citation needed Species Streptococcus classified based hemolytic properties. Alphahemolytic species cause oxidization iron hemoglobin molecules within red blood cells, giving greenish color blood agar. Betahemolytic species cause complete rupture red blood cells. On blood agar, appears wide areas clear blood cells surrounding bacterial colonies. Gammahemolytic species cause hemolysis.citation needed Betahemolytic streptococci classified Lancefield grouping, serotype classification is, describing specific carbohydrates present bacterial cell wall. The described serotypes named Lancefield groups A W excluding I J. This system classification developed Rebecca Lancefield, scientist Rockefeller University.citation needed In medical setting, important groups alphahemolytic streptococci S. pneumoniae Streptococcus viridans group, betahemolytic streptococci Lancefield groups A B also known group A strep group B strep. Table: Medically relevant streptococci alphahemolytic When alphahemolysis αhemolysis present, agar colony appear dark greenish due conversion hemoglobin green biliverdin. Streptococcus pneumoniae group oral streptococci Streptococcus viridans viridans streptococci display alphahemolysis. Alphahemolysis also termed incomplete hemolysis partial hemolysis cell membranes red blood cells left intact. This also sometimes called green hemolysis color change agar. Betahemolysis βhemolysis, sometimes called complete hemolysis, complete lysis red cells media around colonies: area appears lightened yellow transparent. Streptolysin, exotoxin, enzyme produced bacteria causes complete lysis red blood cells. There two types streptolysin: Streptolysin O SLO streptolysin S SLS. Streptolysin O oxygensensitive cytotoxin, secreted group A Streptococcus GAS, interacts cholesterol membrane eukaryotic cells mainly red white blood cells, macrophages, platelets, usually results betahemolysis surface blood agar. Streptolysin S oxygenstable cytotoxin also produced GAS strains results clearing surface blood agar. SLS affects immune cells, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes lymphocytes, thought prevent host immune system clearing infection. Streptococcus pyogenes, GAS, displays beta hemolysis. Some weakly betahemolytic species cause intense hemolysis grown together strain Staphylococcus. This called CAMP test. Streptococcus agalactiae displays property. Clostridium perfringens identified presumptively test. Listeria monocytogenes also positive sheep's blood agar. Group A S. pyogenes causative agent wide range group A streptococcal infections GAS. These infections may noninvasive invasive. The noninvasive infections tend common less severe. The common infections include streptococcal pharyngitis strep throat impetigo. Scarlet fever also noninvasive infection, common recent years. The invasive infections caused group A betahemolytic streptococci tend severe less common. This occurs bacterium able infect areas usually found, blood organs. The diseases may caused include streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis, pneumonia, bacteremia. Globally, GAS estimated cause , deaths every year, making one world's leading pathogens. Additional complications may caused GAS, namely acute rheumatic fever acute glomerulonephritis. Rheumatic fever, disease affects joints, kidneys, heart valves, consequence untreated strep A infection caused bacterium itself. Rheumatic fever caused antibodies created immune system fight infection crossreacting proteins body. This "crossreaction" causes body essentially attack leads damage above. A similar autoimmune mechanism initiated Group A betahemolytic streptococcal GABHS infection hypothesized cause pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated streptococcal infections PANDAS, wherein autoimmune antibodies affect basal ganglia, causing rapid onset psychiatric, motor, sleep, symptoms pediatric patients. GAS infection generally diagnosed rapid strep test culture. S. agalactiae, group B streptococcus, GBS, causes pneumonia meningitis newborns elderly, occasional systemic bacteremia. Importantly, Streptococcus agalactiae common cause meningitis infants one month three months old. They also colonize intestines female reproductive tract, increasing risk premature rupture membranes pregnancy, transmission organism infant. The American College Obstetricians Gynecologists, American Academy Pediatrics, Centers Disease Control recommend pregnant women weeks gestation tested GBS. Women test positive given prophylactic antibiotics labor, usually prevent transmission infant. The United Kingdom chosen adopt risk factorbased protocol, rather culturebased protocol followed US. Current guidelines state one following risk factors present, woman treated intrapartum antibiotics: This protocol results administration intrapartum antibiotics – pregnant women prevention – cases early onset GBS sepsis. This group includes S. equi, causes strangles horses, S. zooepidemicusS. equi clonal descendant biovar ancestral S. zooepidemicuswhich causes infections several species mammals, including cattle horses. S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae also member group C, betahaemolytic streptococci cause pharyngitis pyogenic infections similar group A streptococci. Many former group D streptococci reclassified placed genus Enterococcus including E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. durans, E. avium. For example, Streptococcus faecalis Enterococcus faecalis. E. faecalis sometimes alphahemolytic E. faecium sometimes beta hemolytic. The remaining nonenterococcal group D strains include Streptococcus gallolyticus, Streptococcus bovis Streptococcus equinus. Nonhemolytic streptococci rarely cause illness. However, weakly hemolytic group D betahemolytic streptococci Listeria monocytogenes actually grampositive bacillus confused nonhemolytic streptococci. Group F streptococci first described Long Bliss amongst "minute haemolytic streptococci". They also known Streptococcus anginosus according Lancefield classification system members S. milleri group according European system. These streptococci usually, exclusively, betahemolytic. Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. canis predominant subspecies encountered. It particularly common GGS humans, although typically found animals. S. phocae GGS subspecies found marine mammals marine fish species. In marine mammals mainly associated meningoencephalitis, sepsis, endocarditis, also associated many pathologies. Its environmental reservoir means transmission marine mammals well characterized. Group H streptococci cause infections mediumsized canines. Group H streptococci rarely cause human illness unless human direct contact mouth canine. One common ways spread humantocanine, mouthtomouth contact. However, canine may lick human's hand infection spread, well. Streptococci divided six groups basis S rDNA sequences: S. anginosus, S. gallolyticus, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. pyogenes S. salivarius. The S groups confirmed whole genome sequencing see figure. The important pathogens S. pneumoniae S. pyogenes belong S. mitis S. pyogenes groups, respectively, causative agent dental caries, Streptococcus mutans, basal Streptococcus group. Recent technological advances resulted increase available genome sequences Streptococcus species, allowing robust reliable phylogenetic comparative genomic analyses conducted. In , evolutionary relationships within Streptococcus reexamined Patel Gupta analysis comprehensive phylogenetic trees constructed based four different datasets proteins identification highly specific molecular signatures form conserved signature indels exclusively shared entire genus distinct subclades. The results revealed presence two main clades highest level within Streptococcus, termed MitisSuis PygogenesEquinusMutans clades. The MitisSuis main clade comprises Suis subclade Mitis clade, encompasses Angiosus, Pneumoniae, Gordonii Parasanguinis subclades. The second main clade, PygogenesEquinusMutans, includes Pyogenes, Mutans, Salivarius, Equinus, Sobrinus, Halotolerans, Porci, Entericus Orisratti subclades. In total, distinct subclades identified within genus Streptococcus, supported reliable branching patterns phylogenetic trees presence multiple conserved signature indels different proteins distinctive characteristics members clades.

Bacteriophages described many species Streptococcus. prophages described S. pneumoniae range size kb size, encoding genes each.citation needed Some first Streptococcus phages discovered Dp ω alias ω. In Cp Complutense phage , officially Streptococcus virus Cp, Picovirinae family discovered Cp first member. Dp Cp infect S. pneumoniae S. mitis. However, host ranges Streptococcus phages investigated systematically. Natural genetic transformation involves transfer DNA one bacterium another surrounding medium. Transformation complex process dependent expression numerous genes. To capable transformation bacterium must enter special physiologic state referred competence. S. pneumoniae, S. mitis S. oralis become competent, result actively acquire homologous DNA transformation predatory fratricidal mechanism This fratricidal mechanism mainly exploits noncompetent siblings present niche Among highly competent isolates S. pneumoniae, Li et al. showed nasal colonization fitness virulence lung infectivity depend intact competence system. Competence may allow streptococcal pathogen use external homologous DNA recombinational repair DNA damages caused hosts oxidative attack.
