Neisseria flavescens first isolated cerebrospinal fluid midst epidemic meningitis outbreak Chicago. These gramnegative, aerobic bacteria reside mucosal membranes upper respiratory tract, functioning commensals. However, species also play pathogenic role immunocompromised diabetic individuals. In rare cases, linked meningitis, pneumonia, empyema, endocarditis, sepsis. These bacteria gramnegative diplococcus, rendering virtually indistinguishable Neisseria species. Yet, Neisseria flavescens remains distinct due signature pigmented colonies, yellowgold color. And yellowgold color bacteria earned name, flavescens precisely translating "becoming golden yellow." This pigmentation also indicates N. flavescens' similarity saccharolytic Neisseria species, also exhibit pigmentation. In addition, pigmented species differ meningococcus, lack pigmentation. Similar saccharolytic species, N. flavescens strains capable producing polysaccharides sucrose colistinsusceptible. This bacteria also catalase oxidase positive. It capable acidproduction glucose, maltose, fructose, sucrose, mannose, lactose, contrast meningococcus, activefermenters. Furthermore, fundamental differences two species shown, serological testing reveals N. flavescens' lack crossagglutination. At time, biochemical testing distinguishes Neisseria flavescens gramnegative diplococci, N. flavescens DNase negative, weakly positive Superoxol, capable prolyl aminopeptidase production enzymesubstrate test. Though shares many similarities saccharolytic species, Neisseria flavescens greater genetic relation pathogenic Neisseria species, molecular studies shown. In addition, studies implicate species plays role penicillinresistant strains Neisseria meningitidis. The increasing selective pressure penicillin treatment led N. meningitidis' uptake altered penicillinbinding protein gene, penA, Neisseria flavescens via transformation. This modified penicillinbinding protein, also known mecA, inhibits Neisseria meningitidis' transpeptidases binding βlactam portion penicillin. Typically serving commensal, Neisseria flavescens also played pathogenic role, ever since origin. Arising epidemic meningitis outbreak Chicago, N. flavescens isolated cerebrospinal fluid infected individuals. In particular, fortyseven total cases meningitis, fourteen individuals found carry N. flavescens, contrast carrying one typical four meningococci. Additionally, mortality rate among fourteen individuals close thirty percent, indicating bacterium's role possible causative agent meningitis overlooked. Since then, four cases meningitis also found Neisseria flavescens causative agent. Along meningitis, organism also linked sepsis following surgery. A patient presented clinical signs typical meningococcalstrains: fever, chills, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, skin rash. To identify causative agent, smears skin lesions blood cultures obtained patient. Gramnegative, diplococci present smear, narrowing organism Neisseria species. Ultimately, blood cultures revealed N. flavescens culprit, due observation yellowgold colony formation sugar fermentation. In addition blood CSF, Neisseria flavescens also act pathogen lower respiratory tract. Isolation via transthoracic pulmonary fineneedle aspiration identified N. flavescens cause pneumonia empyema diabetic patient. More specifically, aspirate sent respiration department, underwent acid fast gram staining, inoculation, biochemical testing identify N. flavescens. Next, S rRNA sequencing done, confirming Neisseria flavescens indeed causative agent. Lastly, bacteria also pathogen behind case endocarditis. Testing βlactamase positive, Neisseria flavescens rendered penicillin ineffective treatment patient and, instead, targeted cefotaxime.
