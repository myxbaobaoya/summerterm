Ruminococcus genus bacteria class Clostridia. They anaerobic, Grampositive gut microbes. One species genus found significant numbers human gut microbiota. The type species R. flavefaciens. As usual, bacteria taxonomy flux, Clostridia paraphyletic, erroneous members Ruminococcus reassigned new genus Blautia basis S rRNA gene sequences. One highly cited papers involving genus Ruminococcus paper describing interspecies hydrogen transfer Ruminococcus albus Wolinella succinogenes. In , Ruminococcus bromii reportedly found human gut, first several species discovered. They may play role plant cell wall breakdown colon. One study found R. albus, R. callidus, R. bromii less abundant people inflammatory bowel disease. Ruminococcus also less abundant patients Parkinson's disease. R. gnavus associated Crohn's disease. Species belonging Lachnospiraceae family therefore need reclassification:
