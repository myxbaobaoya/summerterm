Indiana vesiculovirus formerly Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus VSIV VSV virus family Rhabdoviridae wellknown Rabies lyssavirus belongs family VSIV infect insects cattle horses pigs It particular importance farmers certain regions world infects cattle This clinical presentation identical important foot mouth disease virus The virus zoonotic leads flulike illness infected humans It also common laboratory virus used study properties viruses family Rhabdoviridae well study viral evolution Indiana vesiculovirus prototypic member genus Vesiculovirus family Rhabdoviridae VSIV arbovirus replication occurs cytoplasm Natural VSIV infections encompass two steps cytolytic infections mammalian hosts transmission insects In insects infections noncytolytic persistent One confirmed vector virus phlebotomine sand fly Lutzomyia shannoni The genome VSIV single molecule negativesense RNA nucleotides length encodes five major proteins G protein G large protein L phosphoprotein P matrix protein M nucleoprotein N The VSIV G protein aka VSVG enables viral entry It mediates viral attachment LDL receptor LDLR LDLR family member present host cell Following binding VSIVLDLR complex rapidly endocytosed It mediates fusion viral envelope endosomal membrane VSIV enters cell partially clathrincoated vesicles viruscontaining vesicles contain clathrin clathrin adaptor conventional vesicles Viruscontaining vesicles recruit components actin machinery interaction thus inducing uptake VSIV G follow path vesicles transport G protein ER plasma membrane interrupted incubation Â°C Under condition molecules accumulate ER subcellular vesicle fraction low density called lipidrich vesicle fraction The material lipidrich vesicle fraction appears postER intermediate transport process plasma membrane PM After infection VSIV G gene expressed commonly studied model Nlinked glycosylation endoplasmic reticulum ER It translated rough ER GlcManGlcNac oligosaccharide added dolicholcontaining protein NXS motif VSIV G Sugars removed gradually protein travels Golgi apparatus becomes resistant endoglycosidase H When synthesized polarized epithelial cells envelope glycoprotein VSV G targeted basolateral PM VSVG also common coat protein lentiviral vector expression systems used introduce genetic material vitro systems animal models mainly extremely broad tropism The VSIV L protein encoded half genome combines phosphoprotein catalyze replication mRNA The VSIV M protein encoded mRNA nucleotides long translates amino acidprotein The predicted M protein sequence contain long hydrophobic nonpolar domains might promote membrane association The protein rich basic amino acids contains highly basic amino terminal domain The VSV N protein required initiate genome synthesis The main sign animals oral disease appearing mucosal vesicles ulcers mouth also udder around coronary band Animals may show systemic signs anorexia lethargy pyrexia fever Disease usually resolves within two weeks animals usually recover completely Cases human infection vesicular stomatitis virus described Most cases among laboratory workers veterinarians livestock handlers In cases VSV infection resulted short day illness characterized fever headache myalgia weakness occasionally vesicular lesions mouth Serological testing commonly performed ELISA complement fixation viral isolation also attempted No specific treatment available animals may require supportive fluids antibiotics secondary infections Control relies biosecurity protocols quarantine isolation disinfection ensure viral disease enter country herd In healthy human cells virus cannot reproduce likely interferon response allows cells adequately respond viral infection The cannot said interferon nonresponsive cancer cells quality allows VSIV grow lyse oncogenic cells preferentially Recently attenuated VSIV mutation M protein found oncolytic properties Research ongoing shown VSIV reduce tumor size spread melanoma lung cancer colon cancer certain brain tumors laboratory models cancer VSIV modified attack HIVinfected Tcells The modified virus called "trojan horse" virus Recombinant VSIV undergone phase trials vaccine Ebola virus Recombinant VSIV expressing Ebola virus glycoprotein undergone phase III trials Africa vaccine Ebola virus disease The vaccine shown effective preventing Ebola virus disease see also rVSVZEBOV vaccine In December Merck Cos rVSVZEBOV vaccine Ervebo approved Food Drug Administration treat individuals older Replication competent rVSV also created expressing proteins Lassa fever Marburg virus The VSIV G protein routinely used biomedical research pseudotype retroviral lentiviral vectors conferring ability transduce broad range mammalian cell types genes interest The VSIV G protein also used cytological studies trafficking endomembrane system Immunoelectron microscopy suggests VSIV G protein moves cis trans Golgi bodies without transported vesicles supporting cisternal maturation model Golgi trafficking VSV often used perform quantitative computational studies viral genome replication transcription Such studies help build better understanding viral behavior presence absence innate immune response In possible vaccine COVID disease caused SARSCoV developed based modified VSV The modification involved replacing VSVs surface protein genes SARSCoVs spike proteins
