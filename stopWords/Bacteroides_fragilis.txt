Bacteroides fragilis anaerobic, Gramnegative, pleomorphic rodshaped bacterium. It part normal microbiota human colon generally commensal, cause infection displaced bloodstream surrounding tissue following surgery, disease, trauma. Bacteroides fragilis resides human gastrointestinal tract essential healthy gastrointestinal function mucosal immunity host nutrition. As mesophile, optimal growth occurs °C pH around . Cells B. fragilis rodshaped pleomorphic cell size range .. x .. μm.B. fragilis Gramnegative bacterium possess flagella cilia making immotile. However, utilize peritrichous fimbriae adhesion molecular structures. B. fragilis also utilizes complex series surface proteins, lipopolysaccharide chains, outer membrane vesicles help survive volatile intestinal microenvironment. B. fragilis aerotolerant, anaerobic chemoorganotroph capable fermenting wide variety glycans available human gut microenvironment including glucose, sucrose, fructose. Can also catabolize variety biopolymers, polysaccharides, glycoproteins smaller molecules used broken microbes. Also produces fatty acid byproduct carbohydrate fermentation used energy host. It discovered Cytochrome bd oxidase essential oxygen consumption. This allow obligate anaerobes survive oxygenreduced microenvironment. Animals lacking gut bacteria require caloric intake maintain body mass. The complex environmentalsensory system allows B. fragilis surviveadapt everchanging human gut microbiome. This system composed ofdesigned effectively handle: Bacteriocins: B. fragilis intestinal isolates secrete high levels bacteriocin proteins resistant bacteriocins secreted closely related isolates. This mechanism believed reduce level intraspecific competition. Bile salt resistance: Utilizes enzymes "bile salt hydrolase" resist degrading effects bile salts. Detergent activity bile salts permeabilize bacterial membranes eventually lead membrane collapse andor cell damage. Oxidative Stress Response: Proteins catalase, superoxide dismutase, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase protect organism harmful oxygen radicals. This permits growth presence nanomolar concentrations O. Member genus Bacteroides characterized highest numbers antibiotic resistance mechanisms accompanied highest resistance rates amongst anaerobic bacteria. Species Bacteroidaceae displayed increasing resistance antimicrobial agents cefoxitin, clindamycin, metronidazole, carbapenems, fluoroquinalones. Resistance Reservoirs: Bacteroides species accumulate variety antibioticantimicrobial resistance genes reside gastrointestinal tract. This allows genetic transfer genes Bacteroides species possibly virulent bacteria leading overall increase multidrug resistance. This exacerbated tendency resistance genes relatively stable even without presence antibiotic. The B. fragilis group commonly isolated Bacteroidaceae anaerobic infections, especially originate gastrointestinal microbiota. B. fragilis prevalent organism B. fragilis group, accounting isolates group. These organisms resistant penicillin virtue production betalactamase, unknown factors. This group formerly classified subspecies B. fragilis i.e. B. f. ssp. fragilis, B. f. ssp. distasonis, B. f. ssp. ovatus, B. f. ssp. thetaiotaomicron, B. f. ssp. vulgatus. They reclassified distinct species basis DNA homology studies. B. fragilis formerly known B. f. ssp. fragilis often recovered blood, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, wounds, brain abscesses. Although B. fragilis group common species found clinical specimens, least common Bacteroides present fecal microbiota, comprising . bacteria present stool. Their pathogenicity partly results ability produce capsular polysaccharide, protective phagocytosis stimulates abscess formation. Bacteroides fragilis involved anaerobic peritoneal infections. It also causes bacteremia associated intraabdominal infections, peritonitis abscesses following rupture viscus, subcutaneous abscesses burnsnear anus. Though gram negative, altered LPS cause endotoxic shock. Untreated B. fragilis infections mortality rate.
