uncommon Some isolates influenza A virus cause severe disease domestic poultry rarely humans Occasionally viruses transmitted wild aquatic birds domestic poultry may cause outbreak give rise human influenza pandemics Influenza A viruses negativesense singlestranded segmented RNA viruses The several subtypes labeled according H number type hemagglutinin N number type neuraminidase There different known H antigens H H different known N antigens N N HN isolated fruit bats HN discovered Peruvian bat Each virus subtype mutated variety strains differing pathogenic profiles pathogenic one species others pathogenic multiple species A filtered purified influenza A vaccine humans developed many countries stockpiled allow quick administration population event avian influenza pandemic Avian influenza sometimes called avian flu colloquially bird flu In researchers reported discovery antibody effective types influenza A virus Influenza type A viruses RNA viruses categorized subtypes based type two proteins surface viral envelope The hemagglutinin central viruss recognizing binding target cells also infecting cell RNA The neuraminidase hand critical subsequent release daughter virus particles created within infected cell spread cells Different influenza viruses encode different hemagglutinin neuraminidase proteins For example HN virus designates influenza A subtype type hemagglutinin H protein type neuraminidase N protein There known types hemagglutinin known types neuraminidase theory different combinations proteins possible Some variants identified named according isolate resemble thus presumed share lineage example Fujian flu viruslike according typical host example human flu virus according subtype example HN according deadliness example LP low pathogenic So flu virus similar isolate AFujianHN called Fujian flu human flu HN flu Variants sometimes named according species host strain endemic adapted The main variants named using convention Variants also sometimes named according deadliness poultry especially chickens Most known strains extinct strains For example annual flu subtype HN longer contains strain caused Hong Kong flu The annual flu also called "seasonal flu" "human flu" US "results approximately deaths hospitalizations year In addition human toll influenza annually responsible total cost billion US" Globally toll influenza virus estimated – deaths annually exceeding previous estimates The annually updated trivalent influenza vaccine consists hemagglutinin HA surface glycoprotein components influenza HN HN B influenza viruses Measured resistance standard antiviral drugs amantadine rimantadine HN increased "Contemporary human HN influenza viruses endemic pigs southern China reassort avian HN viruses intermediate host" FI antibody targets hemagglutinin protein discovered FI known antibody effective subtypes influenza A virus Influenza type A viruses similar structure influenza viruses types B C D The virus particle also called virion – nanometers diameter smallest virions adopt elliptical shape The length particle varies considerably owing fact influenza pleomorphic excess many tens micrometers producing filamentous virions Confusion nature influenza virus pleomorphy stems observation lab adapted strains typically lose ability form filaments lab adapted strains first visualized electron microscopy Despite varied shapes virions influenza type A viruses similar composition They made viral envelope containing two main types proteins wrapped around central core The two large proteins found outside viral particles hemagglutinin HA neuraminidase NA HA protein mediates binding virion target cells entry viral genome target cell NA involved release abundant nonproductive attachment sites present mucus well release progeny virions infected cells These proteins usually targets antiviral drugs Furthermore also antigen proteins hosts antibodies bind trigger immune response Influenza type A viruses categorized subtypes based type two proteins surface viral envelope There subtypes HA subtypes NA known H N commonly found humans The central core virion contains viral genome viral proteins package protect genetic material Unlike genomes organisms including humans animals plants bacteria made doublestranded DNA many viral genomes made different singlestranded nucleic acid called RNA Unusually virus though influenza type A virus genome single piece RNA instead consists segmented pieces negativesense RNA piece containing either one two genes code gene product protein The term negativesense RNA implies RNA genome cannot translated protein directly must first transcribed positivesense RNA translated protein products The segmented nature genome allows exchange entire genes different viral strains The entire Influenza A virus genome bases long contained eight RNA segments code least proteins depending strain The relevance presence alternate gene products vary The RNA segments viral genome complementary base sequences terminal ends allowing bond hydrogen bonds Transcription viral sense genome vRNA proceed PB protein binds host capped RNAs allowing PA subunit cleave several nucleotides cap This hostderived cap accompanied nucleotides serve primer viral transcription initiation Transcription proceeds along vRNA stretch several uracil bases reached initiating stuttering whereby nascent viral mRNA polyadenylated producing mature transcript nuclear export translation host machinery The RNA synthesis takes place cell nucleus synthesis proteins takes place
