Streptococcus sanguinis, formerly known Streptococcus sanguis, Grampositive facultative anaerobic coccus species bacteria member Viridans Streptococcus group. S. sanguinis normal inhabitant healthy human mouth particularly found dental plaque, modifies environment make less hospitable strains Streptococcus cause cavities, Streptococcus mutans. S. sanguinis may gain entrance bloodstream opportunity presents dental cleanings surgeries colonize heart valves, particularly mitral aortic valves, common cause subacute bacterial endocarditis. For reason, oral surgeons often prescribe short course antibiotics taken days days oral surgery. Once infection occurred, treatment much complicated generally involves administration several weeks penicillin aminoglycoside antibiotics. The complete genomic sequence S. sanguinis determined laboratories Virginia Commonwealth University. The genome spans ,, bp larger streptococcal genomes sequenced. The GC content S. sanguinis genome . higher GC contents streptococci. The genome encodes , predicted proteins, tRNAs, four rRNA operons. About open reading frames conserved hypothetical proteins present multiple species unknown functions, approximately predicted proteins confirmed mass spectrometry. S. sanguinis naturally competent genetic transformation. Natural genetic transformation sexual process involving DNA transfer one bacterial cell another intervening medium, integration donor sequence recipient genome homologous recombination. All essential genes examined S. sanguinis. Essential genes indispensable genes organisms grow reproduce progeny certain environment. The use metabolic networks study essential genes whole indicates essential genes related biological functions genetic information processing, cell envelope energy production. An essential genes database ePath bacterial species developed based finding.
