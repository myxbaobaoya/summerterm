The Epstein–Barr virus EBV formally called Human gammaherpesvirus one nine known human herpesvirus types herpes family one common viruses humans EBV doublestranded DNA virus It best known cause infectious mononucleosis "mono" "glandular fever" It also associated various nonmalignant premalignant malignant Epstein–Barr virusassociated lymphoproliferative diseases Burkitt lymphoma hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis Hodgkins lymphoma nonlymphoid malignancies gastric cancer nasopharyngeal carcinoma conditions associated human immunodeficiency virus hairy leukoplakia central nervous system lymphomas The virus also associated childhood disorders Alice Wonderland syndrome acute cerebellar ataxia based evidence higher risks developing certain autoimmune diseases especially dermatomyositis systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis Sjögrens syndrome About cancer cases globally per year thought attributable EBV In large study population million years suggested EBV leading cause multiple sclerosis recent EBV infection causing fold increase risk developing multiple sclerosis Infection EBV occurs oral transfer saliva genital secretions Most people become infected EBV gain adaptive immunity In United States half fiveyearold children adults evidence previous infection Infants become susceptible EBV soon maternal antibody protection disappears Many children become infected EBV infections usually cause symptoms indistinguishable mild brief illnesses childhood In United States developed countries many people infected EBV childhood years When infection EBV occurs adolescence causes infectious mononucleosis time EBV infects B cells immune system epithelial cells Once EBVs initial lytic infection brought control EBV latency persists individuals memory B cells rest life The virus – nm diameter composed double helix deoxyribonucleic acid DNA contains base pairs encoding genes The DNA surrounded protein nucleocapsid surrounded tegument made protein turn surrounded envelope containing lipids surface projections glycoproteins essential infection host cell In July team researchers reported first complete atomic model nucleocapsid virus This "first complete atomic model includes icosahedral capsid capsidassociated tegument complex CATC dodecameric portalthe viral genome translocation apparatus" The term viral tropism refers cell types EBV infects EBV infect different cell types including B cells epithelial cells The viral threepart glycoprotein complexes gHgL gp mediate B cell membrane fusion although twopart complexes gHgL mediate epithelial cell membrane fusion EBV made B cells low numbers gHgLgp complexes threepart complexes interact Humanleukocyteantigen class II molecules present B cells endoplasmic reticulum degraded In contrast EBV epithelial cells rich threepart complexes cells normally contain HLA class II molecules As consequence EBV made B cells infectious epithelial cells EBV made epithelial cells infectious B cells Viruses lacking gp portion able bind human B cells unable infect EBV infect B cells epithelial cells The mechanisms entering two cells different To enter B cells viral glycoprotein gp binds cellular receptor CD also known CR Then viral glycoprotein gp interacts cellular MHC class II molecules This triggers fusion viral envelope cell membrane allowing EBV enter B cell Human CD also known complement receptor CR additional attachment factor gp provide route entry EBV CDnegative cells including immature Bcells EBV infection downregulates expression CD To enter epithelial cells viral protein BMRF interacts cellular β integrins Then viral protein gHgL interacts cellular αvβαvβ integrins This triggers fusion viral envelope epithelial cell membrane allowing EBV enter epithelial cell Unlike Bcell entry epithelialcell entry actually impeded viral glycoprotein gp Once EBV enters cell viral capsid dissolves viral genome transported cell nucleuscitation needed The lytic cycle productive infection results production infectious virions EBV undergo lytic replication B cells epithelial cells In B cells lytic replication normally takes place reactivation latency In epithelial cells lytic replication often directly follows viral entry For lytic replication occur viral genome must linear The latent EBV genome circular must linearize process lytic reactivation During lytic replication viral DNA polymerase responsible copying viral genome This contrasts latency hostcell DNA polymerase copies viral genome Lytic gene products produced three consecutive stages immediateearly early late Immediateearly lytic gene products act transactivators enhancing expression later lytic genes Immediateearly lytic gene products include BZLF also known Zta EB associated product gene ZEBRA BRLF associated product gene Rta Early lytic gene products many functions replication metabolism blockade antigen processing Early lytic gene products include BNLF Finally late lytic gene products tend proteins structural roles VCA forms viral capsid Other late lytic gene products BCRF help EBV evade immune system EGCG polyphenol green tea shown study inhibit EBV spontaneous lytic infection DNA gene transcription protein levels time dosedependent manner expression EBV lytic genes Zta Rta early antigen complex EAD induced Rta however highly stable EBNA gene found across stages EBV infection unaffected Specific inhibitors pathways suggest RasMEKMAPK pathway contributes EBV lytic infection though BZLF PIK pathway BRLF latter completely abrogating ability BRLF adenovirus vector induce lytic form EBV infection Additionally activation genes others studied determine induce immune destruction latently infected Bcells use either TPA sodium butyrate Unlike lytic replication latency result production virions Instead EBV genome circular DNA resides cell nucleus episome copied cellular DNA polymerase In latency portion EBVs genes expressed Latent EBV expresses genes one three patterns known latency programs EBV latently persist within B cells epithelial cells different latency programs possible two types cellcitation needed EBV exhibit one three latency programs Latency I Latency II Latency III Each latency program leads production limited distinct set viral proteins viral RNAs Also program postulated viral protein expression shut Latency Within B cells three latency programs possible EBV latency within B cells usually progresses Latency III Latency II Latency I Each stage latency uniquely influences B cell behavior Upon infecting resting naive B cell EBV enters Latency III The set proteins RNAs produced Latency III transforms B cell proliferating blast also known B cell activation Later virus restricts gene expression enters Latency II The limited set proteins RNAs produced Latency II induces B cell differentiate memory B cell Finally EBV restricts gene expression even enters Latency I Expression EBNA allows EBV genome replicate memory B cell divides Within epithelial cells Latency II possible In primary infection EBV replicates oropharyngeal epithelial cells establishes Latency III II I infections Blymphocytes EBV latent infection Blymphocytes necessary virus persistence subsequent replication epithelial cells release infectious virus saliva EBV Latency III II infections Blymphocytes Latency II infection oral epithelial cells Latency II infection NK Tcell result malignancies marked uniform EBV genome presence gene expression Latent EBV B cells reactivated switch lytic replication This known happen vivo triggers known precisely In vitro latent EBV B cells reactivated stimulating B cell receptor reactivation vivo probably takes place latently infected B cells respond unrelated infections When EBV infects B cells vitro lymphoblastoid cell lines eventually emerge capable indefinite growth The growth transformation cell lines consequence viral protein expressioncitation needed EBNA EBNAC LMP essential transformation whereas EBNALP EBERs Following natural infection EBV virus thought execute repertoire gene expression programs establish persistent infection Given initial absence host immunity lytic cycle produces large numbers virions infect presumably Blymphocytes within host The latent programs reprogram subvert infected Blymphocytes proliferate bring infected cells sites virus presumably persists Eventually host immunity develops virus persists turning possibly genes occasionally reactivating produce fresh virions A balance eventually struck occasional viral reactivation host immune surveillance removing cells activate viral gene expression The site persistence EBV may bone marrow EBVpositive patients bone marrow replaced bone marrow EBVnegative donor found EBVnegative
