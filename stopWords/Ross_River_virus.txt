Ross River virus RRV small encapsulated singlestrand RNA Alphavirus endemic Australia Papua New Guinea islands South Pacific It responsible type mosquitoborne nonlethal extremely debilitating tropical disease known Ross River fever previously termed "epidemic polyarthritis" There known cure last system host years The virus suspected enzootic populations various native Australian mammals found occasion horses Taxonomically Ross River virus belongs virus genus Alphavirus part family Togaviridae The alphaviruses group small enveloped singlestrand positivesense RNA viruses RRV belongs subgroup "Old World" EurasianAfricanAustralasian alphaviruses considered closely related Sagiyama virus The virions virus particles contain genome protein capsid Å diameter They characterised presence two glycoproteins E E embedded trimeric dimers hostderived lipid envelope Because RRV transmitted mosquitos considered arbovirus nontaxonomic term viruses borne arthropod vectors In outbreak acute febrile arthritis recorded Narrandera Hay New South Wales Australia In several outbreaks arthralgia arthritis described Northern Territory Queensland Schouten Islands northern coast Papua New Guinea The name "epidemic polyarthritis" coined disease In epidemic occurred Murray Valley compared "acute viral polyarthritis" caused Chikungunya virus The Australian disease seemed progress milder fashion In serological testing suggested unknown new species alphavirus group A arbovirus likely culprit In July August virus recovered mosquitoes collected near Tokyo Japan dubbed Sagiyama virus For time thought separate species considered conspecific Ross River virus In new alphavirus identified samples mosquito Aedes vigilax trapped Ross River located Townsville Queensland Australia Further serological testing showed patients suffered "epidemic polyarthritis" Queensland antibodies virus The new virus named Ross River virus disease Ross River fever The virus first isolated using suckling mice It found RRV isolated human serum could kill mice However serum containing virus used come Aboriginal boy Edward River North Queensland The child fever rash arthritis making link RRV Ross River fever less concrete The largestever outbreak virus – occurred western Pacific The outbreak involved islands Fiji Samoa Cook Islands New Caledonia However RRV later isolated humans following series epidemic polyarthritis outbreaks Fiji Samoa Cook Islands RRV isolated Australian patient suffering Ross River fever In Ross River virus found made way Aundh area Pune India spread parts city The RRV infection characterised inflammation pain multiple joints Hydration sufficient fluid intake recommended ensure fever rise dangerous levels It also recommended doctor consulted immediately regular paracetamol gives temporary reprieve fevercitation needed In rural regional areas Australia continued prevalence Ross River virus thought supported natural reservoirs large marsupial mammals Antibodies Ross River virus found wide variety placental marsupial mammals also bird species It presently known reservoir hosts support Ross River virus metropolitan areas Brisbane The southern saltmarsh mosquito Aedes camptorhynchus known carry Ross River virus discovered Napier New Zealand Due year program New Zealand Ministry Health later Ministry Agriculture Fisheries species declared completely eradicated New Zealand July As September never report case Ross River virus acquired within New Zealand Separate mosquito species may act vector widespread across areas seasonalgeographical locations In southern northern regions Aedes group A camptorhynchus A vigilax main RRV carriers However inland Culex annulirostris main carrier Aedes mosquitoes becoming active wet seasons Due expansion housing demand south west Western Australia residential development occurring closer wetlands spite fact ecosystem known mosquito breeding Particularly Peel region living near water desirable aesthetic value Over decade June – population increased residents averaging rate per cent per annum In June Peel region accounted approximately five per cent States population predicted account around per cent Western Australias population A study comparing risk contracting Ross River virus RRV distance dwellings Muddy Lakes The reports showed within one kilometre buffer zone approximately mosquitos traps per night Ae camptorhynchus decreasing approximately mosquitos Ae camptorhynchus six kilometre buffer zone The study suggests significantly higher risk contracting RRV living closer Muddy Lakes however rise two kilometre buffer zone mosquitos Ae camptorhynchus A similar trend study study conducted Peel region resulting less mosquitoes away buffer distance In – Leschenault CapelBusselton affected outbreak cases RRV disease Although occurred around decade ago data analysed total RRV cases per persons buffer zone This shows elevated risk contracting disease living close proximity Leschenault Estuary within km strongest disease risk gradient Evidence shows strong correlation contracting RRV living close proximity wetlands south west Western Australia However due continuous growth development residential areas around wetlands expected problems RRV disease occur There several factors contribute individuals risk Ross River virus Australia These risks trialed study conducted tropical Australia illustrate factors camping light coloured clothing exposure certain flora fauna specific protective mechanisms able increase decrease likelihood contracting virus By increasing frequency camping individuals risk increases eightfold suggesting increased exposure wildlife increases risk This shown narrow confidence interval – within study For example individuals exposure kangaroos wallabies bromeliad plants also increased risk suggesting reservoirs infection breeding sites mosquitoes potential vectors virus Although areas show higher risk virus humans still enjoy wildlife consider preventive mechanisms increasingly important camping Ross River virus easily prevented small behavioural mechanisms high importance tropical areas participation outdoor activities Firstly insect repellent rigorously used prevent bites insects specifically include mosquitoes vectors carry disease A study tropical Australia shows narrow confidence interval – decrease Ross River virus risk result increased use insect repellent suggesting strong correlation two Following burning citronella candles based principle repels insects vectors virus Burning candles also show strong correlation decreased Ross River virus risk shown study narrow confidence interval – Secondly wearing light coloured clothing decrease risk Ross River virus threefold This based repelling vectors mosquitoes use bright colours Lastly high risk areas minimised mechanisms prevention applied within households For example screens fitted windows doors prevent entry insects carrying virus potential breeding areas open water containers water holding plants removed Therefore specific climatic environments assessed high risk factors appropriate precautions taken response The study RRV recently facilitated mouse model Inbred mice infected RRV develop hindlimb arthritisarthralgia The disease mice similar humans characterised inflammatory infiltrate including macrophages immunopathogenic exacerbate disease Furthermore recent data indicate serum component C directly contributes disease since mice deficient C protein suffer severe disease following infection Ross River virus cause multiple symptoms someone infected common arthritis joint pain Other symptoms include rash limbs body often occurs roughly days arthritis begins Lymph nodes may enlarge commonly arm pits groin region rarely feeling pins needles persons hands feet occurs small number people The virus also causes moderate symptoms horses The symptoms Ross River virus important recognise early diagnosis therefore early treatment Symptoms illustrated case report infected Thuringian traveller returning SouthEast Australia This case showed flulike symptoms include fever chills headache pains body Additionally joint pain arose joints become swollen joint stiffness particularly noticeable A clinical examination infected individual shows significant decrease specific antibodies despite normal blood count levels A rash good indication likely occur usually disappears ten days The symptoms Ross River virus important aware early treatment administered virus worsens The time catching disease experiencing symptoms anywhere three days three weeks usually takes – weeks A person tested Ross River virus blood test illnesses may need excluded diagnosis Testing Ross River virus occur patients experiencing acute polyarthritis tiredness andor rashes history travel within areas prone infection virus Serology blood tests appropriate manner diagnose Ross River virus Within days infection virus produces Immunoglobulin M IgM presumptive positive diagnosis IgM may persist months even years therefore false positives may triggered Barmah Forest virus rubella Q fever rheumatoid factor To completely test Ross River virus second serology test must conducted – days first The patient may declared positive Ross River virus infection fold increase IgM antibody count Ross River fever also known Ross River virus infection Ross River virus disease Ross River virus named Ross River Townsville place first identified Ross River fever common mosquitoborne disease Australia nearly people reported infected virus year
