Faecalibacterium genus bacteria. Its sole known species, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii grampositive, mesophilic, rodshaped, anaerobic one abundant important commensal bacteria human gut microbiota. It nonspore forming nonmotile. These bacteria produce butyrate shortchain fatty acids fermentation dietary fiber. Formerly considered member Fusobacterium, bacterium named honor German bacteriologist Otto Prausnitz. In , proposed reclassified genus, Faecalibacterium, containing species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, phylogenetic analysis isolates showed distantly related Fusobacterium, closer member Clostridium cluster IV. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii genome ,, bp long GCcontent .. The bacterium found , coding sequences, including RNAs encoding genes. metabolic pathways reconstructed, well protein complexes tRNAs. Phylogenetically, strains F. prausnitzii compose phylogroups I II. Most new isolates species isolated M. Tanweer Khan belong phylogroup II. A protein produced bacterium linked antiinflammatory effects. In healthy adults, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii represent bacteria intestine, making one common gut bacteria. It antiinflammatory properties may improve imbalance intestinal bacteria leads dysbiosis. Lower usual levels F. prausnitzii intestines associated Crohn's disease, obesity, asthma major depressive disorder, higher usual levels associated psoriasis. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii improve gut barrier function. In Crohn's disease, studies one exception found reduced levels F. prausnitzii; found fecal mucosal samples. However, fastidious organism sensitive oxygen difficult deliver intestine. Exclusive enteral nutrition, known induce remission Crohn's, found reduce F. prausnitzii responders.
