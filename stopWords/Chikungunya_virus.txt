Chikungunya infection caused Chikungunya virus CHIKV Symptoms include fever joint pains These typically occur two twelve days exposure Other symptoms may include headache muscle pain joint swelling rash Symptoms usually improve within week however occasionally joint pain may last months years The risk death around The young old health problems risk severe disease The virus spread people two types mosquitos Aedes albopictus Aedes aegypti They mainly bite day The virus may circulate within number animals including birds rodents Diagnosis either testing blood viruss RNA antibodies virus The symptoms mistaken dengue fever Zika fever It believed people become immune single infection The best means prevention overall mosquito control avoidance bites areas disease common This may partly achieved decreasing mosquito access water use insect repellent mosquito nets There vaccine specific treatment Recommendations include rest fluids medications help fever joint pain While disease typically occurs Africa Asia outbreaks reported Europe Americas since In million suspected cases occurred In occurring Florida continental United States locally acquired cases The disease first identified Tanzania The term Kimakonde language means "to become contorted" Around people infected Chikungunya virus experience symptoms typically beginning sudden high fever °C °F The fever soon followed severe muscle joint pain Pain usually affects multiple joints arms legs symmetric – ie one elbow affected well People Chikungunya also frequently experience headache back pain nausea fatigue Around half affected develop rash reddening sometimes small bumps palms foot soles torso face For rash remains constrained small part body others rash extensive covering skin Some people experience gastrointestinal issues abdominal pain vomiting Others experience eye problems namely sensitivity light conjunctivitis pain behind eye This first set symptoms – called "acute phase" Chikungunya – lasts around week symptoms resolve Many people continue symptoms "acute phase" resolves termed "postacute phase" symptoms lasting three weeks three months "chronic stage" symptoms lasting longer three months In cases lasting symptoms tend joint pains arthritis tenosynovitis andor bursitis If affected person preexisting joint issues tend worsen Overuse joint result painful swelling stiffness nerve damage neuropathic pain Typically joint pain improves time however chronic stage last anywhere months several years Joint pain reported – cases nearly always occurs one joint though joint swelling uncommon Typically affected joints located arms legs Joints likely affected previously damaged disorders arthritis Pain commonly occurs peripheral joints wrists ankles joints hands feet well larger joints typically shoulders elbows knees Pain may also occur muscles ligaments In half cases normal activity limited significant fatigue pain Infrequently inflammation eyes may occur form iridocyclitis uveitis retinal lesions may occur Temporary damage liver may occur People Chikungunya occasionally develop neurologic disorders frequently swelling degeneration brain inflammation degneration myelin sheaths around neurons Guillain–Barré syndrome acute disseminated encephalomyelitis hypotonia newborns issues visual processing In particularly rare cases people may develop behavioral changes seizures irritation cerebellum meninges oculomotor nerve palsy paralysis eye muscles Newborns susceptible particularly severe effects Chikungunya infection Signs infection typically begin fever rash swelling extremities Around half newborns mild case oef disease resolves half severe disease inflammation brain seizures In severe cases affected newborns may also issues bleeding bloodflow problems heart function In addition newborns elderly diabetes heart disease liver kidney diseases human immunodeficiency virus infection tend severe cases Chikungunya Around people symptomatic Chikungunya die

Chikungunya virus include Ae furcifertaylori Ae africanus Ae luteocephalus Chikungunya virus passed humans bite infected mosquito breaks skin introduces virus body The pathogenesis chikungunya infection humans still poorly understood despite recent outbreaks It appears vitro Chikungunya virus able replicate human epithelial endothelial cells primary fibroblasts monocytederived macrophages Viral replication highly cytopathic susceptible typeI II interferon In vivo studies using living cells chikungunya virus appears replicate fibroblasts skeletal muscle progenitor cells myofibers The type interferon response seems play important role hosts response chikungunya infection Upon infection chikungunya hosts fibroblasts produce type alpha beta interferon IFNα IFNβ In mouse studies deficiencies INF mice exposed virus cause increased morbidity mortality The chikungunyaspecific upstream components type interferon pathway involved hosts response chikungunya infection still unknown Nonetheless mouse studies suggest IPS important factor IRF IRF important agedependent manner Mouse studies also suggest chikungunya evades host defenses counters typeI interferon response producing NS nonstructural protein degrades RBP turns host cells ability transcribe DNA NS interferes JAKSTAT signaling pathway prevents STAT becoming phosphorylated In acute phase chikungunya virus typically present areas symptoms present specifically skeletal muscles joints In chronic phase suggested viral persistence inability body entirely rid virus lack clearance antigen contribute joint pain The inflammation response acute chronic phase disease results part interactions virus monocytes macrophages Chikungunya virus disease humans associated elevated serum levels specific cytokines chemokines High levels specific cytokines linked severe acute disease interleukin IL ILβ RANTES monocyte chemoattractant protein MCP monokine induced gamma interferon MIG interferon gammainduced protein IP Cytokines may also contribute chronic Chikungunya virus disease persistent joint pain associated elevated levels IL granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor GMCSF In chronic symptoms mild elevation Creactive protein CRP observed suggesting ongoing chronic inflammation However little evidence linking chronic Chikungunya virus disease development autoimmunitycitation needed The virus consists four nonstructural proteins three structural proteins The structural proteins capsid two envelope glycoproteins E E form heterodimeric spikes viron surface E binds cellular receptors order enter host cell receptormediated endocytosis E contains fusion peptide exposed acidity endosome eukaryotic cells dissociates E initiates membrane fusion allows release nucleocapsids host cytoplasm promoting infection The mature virion contains heterodimeric spikes EE release bud surface infected cell released exocytosis infect cells Chikungunya diagnosed basis clinical epidemiological laboratory criteria Clinically acute onset high fever severe joint pain would lead suspicion chikungunya Epidemiological criteria consist whether individual traveled spent time area chikungunya present within last twelve days ie potential incubation period Laboratory criteria include decreased lymphocyte count consistent viremia However definitive laboratory diagnosis accomplished viral isolation RTPCR serological diagnosis The differential diagnosis may include mosquitoborne diseases dengue malaria infections influenza Chronic recurrent polyarthralgia occurs least chikungunya patients one year infection whereas symptoms uncommon dengue Virus isolation provides definitive diagnosis takes one two weeks completion must carried biosafety level III laboratories The technique involves exposing specific cell lines samples whole blood identifying Chikungunya virusspecific responses RTPCR using nested primer pairs used amplify several chikungunyaspecific genes whole blood generating thousands millions copies genes order identify RTPCR also used quantify viral load blood Using RTPCR diagnostic results available one two days Serological diagnosis requires larger amount blood methods uses ELISA assay measure chikungunyaspecific IgM levels blood serum One advantage offered serological diagnosis serum IgM detectable days months onset symptoms drawbacks results may require two three days false positives occur infection due related viruses onyongnyong virus Semliki Forest virus Presently specific way test chronic signs symptoms associated Chikungunya fever although nonspecific laboratory findings C reactive protein elevated cytokines correlate disease activity Because approved vaccine exists effective means prevention protection contact diseasecarrying mosquitoes controlling mosquito populations limiting habitat Mosquito control focuses eliminating standing water mosquitos lay eggs develop larva elimination standing water possible insecticides biological control agents added Methods protection contact mosquitos include using insect repellents substances DEET icaridin PMD pmenthanediol substance derived lemon eucalyptus tree ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate IR However increasing insecticide resistance presents challenge chemical control methodscitation needed Wearing biteproof long sleeves trousers also offers protection garments treated pyrethroids class insecticides often repellent properties Vaporized pyrethroids example mosquito coils also insect repellents As infected mosquitoes often feed rest inside homes securing screens windows doors help keep mosquitoes house In case dayactive A aegypti A albopictus however limited effect since many contacts mosquitoes humans occur outdoorscitation needed As update approved vaccines available A phaseII vaccine trial used live attenuated virus develop viral resistance tested days still showed resistance one year However people reported transient joint pain attenuation found due two mutations E glycoprotein Alternative vaccine strategies developed show efficacy mouse models In August researchers National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases USA testing experimental vaccine uses viruslike particles VLPs instead attenuated virus All people participated phase trial developed strong immune responses As phase trial planned using adults aged take place locations Caribbean Even vaccine mosquito population control bite prevention necessary control chikungunya disease In two vaccine manufacturers one France United States reported successful completion Phase II clinical trials Currently specific treatment chikungunya available Supportive care recommended symptomatic treatment fever joint swelling includes use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs naproxen nonaspirin analgesics paracetamol acetaminophen fluids Aspirin recommended due increased risk bleeding Despite antiinflammatory effects corticosteroids recommended acute phase disease may cause immunosuppression worsen infection Passive immunotherapy potential benefit treatment chikungunya Studies animals using passive immunotherapy effective clinical studies using passive immunotherapy particularly vulnerable severe infection currently progress Passive immunotherapy involves administration antiCHIKV hyperimmune human intravenous antibodies immunoglobulins exposed high risk chikungunya infection No antiviral treatment Chikungunya virus currently available though testing shown several medications effective vitro In two weeks arthritis ribavirin may useful The effect chloroquine clear It appear help acute disease tentative evidence indicates might help chronic arthritis Steroids appear effective treatment NSAIDs simple analgesics used provide partial symptom relief cases Methotrexate drug used treatment rheumatoid arthritis shown benefit treating inflammatory polyarthritis resulting chikungunya though drug mechanism improving viral arthritis unclear The mortality rate chikungunya slightly less Those age neonates underlying chronic medical problems likely severe complications Neonates vulnerable possible vertically transmit chikungunya mother infant delivery results high rates morbidity infants lack fully developed immune systems The likelihood prolonged symptoms chronic joint pain increased increased age prior rheumatological disease Historically chikungunya present mostly developing world The disease causes estimated million infections year Epidemics Indian Ocean Pacific Islands Americas continue change distribution disease In Africa chikungunya spread sylvatic cycle virus largely cycles nonhuman primates small mammals mosquitos human outbreaks During outbreaks due high concentration virus blood acute phase infection virus circulate humans mosquitoes back humans The transmission pathogen humans mosquitoes exist urban environments established multiple occasions strains occurring eastern half Africa nonhuman primate hosts This emergence spread beyond Africa may started early th century Currently available data indicate whether introduction chikungunya Asia occurred th century recently epidemic Asian strain causes outbreaks India continues circulate Southeast Asia In Africa outbreaks typically tied heavy rainfall causing increased mosquito population In recent outbreaks urban centers virus spread circulating humans mosquitoes Global rates chikungunya infection variable depending outbreaks When chikungunya first identified lowlevel circulation West Africa infection rates linked rainfall Beginning periodic outbreaks documented Asia Africa However since following several decades relative inactivity chikungunya reemerged caused large outbreaks Africa Asia Americas In India instance chikungunya reappeared following years absence viral activity Outbreaks occurred Europe Caribbean South America areas chikungunya previously transmitted Local transmission also occurred United States Australia countries virus previously unknown In outbreak island Réunion largest documented estimated cases island population approximately In outbreak India reported million suspected cases Chikungunya recently introduced Americas Americas suspected cases confirmed cases reported PAHO An analysis genetic code Chikungunya virus suggests increased severity –present outbreak may due change genetic sequence altered E segment virus viral coat protein variant called EAV This mutation potentially allows virus multiply easily mosquito cells The change allows virus use Asian tiger mosquito invasive species vector addition strictly tropical main vector Aedes aegypti Enhanced transmission Chikungunya virus A albopictus could mean increased risk outbreaks areas Asian tiger mosquito present A albopictus
