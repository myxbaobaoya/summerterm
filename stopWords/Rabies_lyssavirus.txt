Rabies virus scientific name Rabies lyssavirus neurotropic virus causes rabies humans animals Rabies transmission occur saliva animals less commonly contact human saliva Rabies lyssavirus like many rhabdoviruses extremely wide host range In wild found infecting many mammalian species laboratory found birds infected well cell cultures mammals birds reptiles insects Rabies reported countries continents exclusion Antarctica The main burden disease reported Asia Africa cases reported also Europe past years especially returning travellers Rabies lyssavirus cylindrical morphology member Lyssavirus genus Rhabdoviridae family These viruses enveloped single stranded RNA genome negativesense The genetic information packaged ribonucleoprotein complex RNA tightly bound viral nucleoprotein The RNA genome virus encodes five genes whose order highly conserved These genes code nucleoprotein N phosphoprotein P matrix protein M glycoprotein G viral RNA polymerase L The complete genome sequences range nt length All transcription replication events take place cytoplasm inside specialized virus factory Negri body named Adelchi Negri These – µm diameter typical rabies infection thus used definite histological proof infection Rhabdoviruses helical symmetry infectious particles approximately cylindrical shape They characterized extremely broad host spectrum ranging plants insects mammals humaninfecting viruses commonly icosahedral symmetry take shapes approximating regular polyhedra The rabies genome encodes five proteins nucleoprotein N phosphoprotein P matrix protein M glycoprotein G polymerase L All rhabdoviruses two major structural components helical ribonucleoprotein core RNP surrounding envelope In RNP genomic RNA tightly encased nucleoprotein Two viral proteins phosphoprotein large protein Lprotein polymerase associated RNP The glycoprotein forms approximately trimeric spikes tightly arranged surface virus The M protein associated envelope RNP may central protein rhabdovirus assembly Rabies lyssavirus bulletlike shape length nm crosssectional diameter nm One end rounded conical end planar concave The lipoprotein envelope carries knoblike spikes composed Glycoprotein G Spikes cover planar end virion virus particle Beneath envelope membrane matrix M protein layer may invaginated planar end The core virion consists helically arranged ribonucleoprotein The rhabdovirus virion enveloped rod bulletshaped structure containing five protein species The nucleoprotein N coats RNA rate one monomer protein nine nucleotides forming nucleocapsid helical symmetry Associated nucleocapsid copies P phosphoprotein L large protein The L protein well named gene taking half genome Its large size justified fact multifunctional protein The M matrix protein forms layer nucleocapsid envelope trimers G glycoprotein form spikes protrude envelope The genomes rhabdoviruses encode five proteins case Rabies Lyssavirus After receptor binding Rabies lyssavirus enters host cells endosomal transport pathway Inside endosome low pH value induces membrane fusion process thus enabling viral genome reach cytosol Both processes receptor binding membrane fusion catalyzed glycoprotein G plays critical role pathogenesis mutant virus without G proteins cannot propagate The next step entry transcription viral genome PL polymerase P essential cofactor L polymerase order make new viral protein The viral polymerase recognize ribonucleoprotein cannot use free RNA template Transcription regulated cisacting sequences virus genome protein M essential virus budding also regulates fraction mRNA production replication Later infection activity polymerase switches replication order produce fulllength positivestrand RNA copies These complementary RNAs used templates make new negativestrand RNA genomes They packaged together protein N form ribonucleoprotein form new viruses In September Joseph Lennox Pawan Trinidad found Negri bodies brain bat unusual habits In Pawan first discovered infected vampire bats could transmit rabies humans animals From wound entry Rabies lyssavirus travels quickly along neural pathways peripheral nervous system The retrograde axonal transport Rabies lyssavirus central nervous system CNS key step pathogenesis natural infection The exact molecular mechanism transport unknown although binding P protein Rabies lyssavirus dynein light chain protein DYNLL shown P also acts interferon antagonist thus decreasing immune response host From CNS virus spreads organs The salivary glands located tissues mouth cheeks receive high concentrations virus thus allowing transmitted due projectile salivation Fatality occur two days five years time initial infection This however depends largely species animal acting reservoir Most infected mammals die within weeks strains species African yellow mongoose Cynictis penicillata might survive infection asymptomatically years The first symptoms rabies may similar flu including general weakness discomfort fever headache These symptoms may last days There may also discomfort prickling itching sensation site bite progressing within days symptoms cerebral dysfunction anxiety confusion agitation As disease progresses person may experience delirium abnormal behavior hallucinations insomnia Rabies lyssavirus may also inactive hosts body become active long period time Upon viral entry body also vaccination body produces virus neutralizing antibodies bind inactivate virus Specific regions G protein shown antigenic leading production virus neutralizing antibodies These antigenic sites epitopes categorized regions I–IV minor site Previous work demonstrated antigenic sites II III commonly targeted natural neutralizing antibodies Additionally monoclonal antibody neutralizing functionality demonstrated target antigenic site I Other proteins nucleoprotein shown unable elicit production virus neutralizing antibodies The epitopes bind neutralizing antibodies linear conformational All extant rabies viruses appear evolved within last years There seven genotypes Rabies lyssavirus In Eurasia cases due three thesegenotype classical rabies lesser extent genotypes European bat lyssaviruses type Genotype evolved Europe th century spread Asia Africa Americas result European exploration colonization Bat rabies North America appears present since CE confidence interval – CE The rabies virus appears undergone evolutionary shift hosts Chiroptera bats species Carnivora ie raccoon skunk result homologous recombination event occurred hundreds years ago This recombination event altered gene encodes virus glycoprotein necessary receptor recognition binding Rabies lyssavirus used research viral neuronal tracing establish synaptic
