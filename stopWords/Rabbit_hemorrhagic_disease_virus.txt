Rabbit hemorrhagic disease RHD also known viral hemorrhagic disease VHD highly infectious lethal form viral hepatitis affects European rabbits Some viral strains also affect hares cottontail rabbits Mortality rates generally range percent The disease caused strains rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus RHDV lagovirus family Caliciviridae Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus RHDV virus genus Lagovirus family Caliciviridae It nonenveloped virus diameter around – nm icosahedral symmetry linear positivesense RNA genome – kb RHDV causes generalized infection rabbits characterized liver necrosis disseminated intravascular coagulation rapid death Division serotypes defined lack crossneutralization using specific antisera Rabbit lagoviruses also include related caliciviruses European brown hare syndrome virus RHDV appears evolved preexisting avirulent rabbit calicivirus RCV Nonpathogenic rabbit caliciviruses related distinct RHDV circulating apparently harmlessly Europe Australia New Zealand prior emergence RHDV In course evolution RHDV split six distinct genotypes highly pathogenic The three strains rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus medical significance RHDV RHDVa RHDV RHDV also referred RHDV RHDV classical RHD affects adult European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus This virus first reported China spread much Asia Europe Australia elsewhere A isolated outbreaks RHDV occurred United States Mexico remained localized eradicatedcitation needed In new lagovirus distinct antigenic profile identified France The new virus named rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus abbreviated RHDV RHDVb also caused RHD exhibited distinctive genetic antigenic pathogenic features Importantly RHDV killed rabbits previously vaccinated RHDV vaccines affected young European rabbits well hares Lepus spp All features strongly suggest virus derived RHDVa unknown source RHDV since spread majority Europe well Australia Canada United Statescitation needed Both viruses causing RHD extremely contagious Transmission occurs direct contact infected animals carcasses bodily fluids urine feces respiratory secretions hair Surviving rabbits may contagious months Contaminated fomites clothing food cages bedding feeders water also spread virus Flies fleas mosquitoes carry virus rabbits Predators scavengers also spread virus shedding feces Caliciviruses highly resistant environment survive freezing prolonged periods The virus persist infected meat months prolonged periods decomposing carcasses Importation rabbit meat may major contributor spread virus new geographic regions RHD outbreaks tend seasonal wild rabbit populations adults survived infection immune As young kits grow stop nursing longer receive antibodies provided mothers milk become susceptible infection Thus RHD epizootics occur often rabbits breeding season Generally high host specificity exists among lagoviruses Classic RHDVa affects European rabbits species native Europe domestic rabbit descended The new variant RHDV affects European rabbits well also causes fatal RHD various Lepus species including Sardinian Cape hares L capensis mediterraneus Italian hares L corsicanus mountain hares L timidus Reports RHD Sylvilagus species coming current outbreak United States RHD caused RHDV RHDVa demonstrates high morbidity mortality adult European rabbits Young rabbits – weeks old less likely infected kits younger weeks old become ill The recently emerged RHDV causes death disease rabbits young days old Mortality rates RHDV variable Initially less virulent pathogenicity RHDV increasing similar found RHDV RHDVa Deaths RHDV confirmed rabbits previously vaccinated RHDVa These viruses replicate liver mechanisms fully elucidated trigger mass death hepatocytes turn lead disseminated intravascular coagulation hepatic encephalopathy nephrosis Bleeding may occur clotting factors platelets used The incubation period RHDVa – days RHDV – days Rabbits infected RHDV likely show subacute chronic signs infected RHDVa In rabbitries epidemic high mortality rates adult subadult rabbits typical If outbreak caused RHDV deaths also occur young rabbitscitation needed RHD vary rate clinical signs occur In peracute cases rabbits usually found dead premonitory symptoms Rabbits may observed grazing normally immediately death In acute cases rabbits inactive reluctant move They may develop fever °C °F increased heart respiratory rates Bloody discharge nose mouth vulva common blood feces urine Lateral recumbency coma convulsions may observed death Rabbits acute form generally die within hours onset fever Subacute chronic RHD protracted clinical course commonly noted RHDV infections Clinical signs include lethargy anorexia weight loss jaundice Gastrointestinal dilation cardiac arrhythmias heart murmurs neurologic abnormalities also occur Death occurs usually happens – weeks onset symptoms due liver failure Not rabbits exposed RHDVa RHDV become overtly ill A small proportion infected rabbits clears virus without developing signs disease Asymptomatic carriers also occur continue shed virus months thereby infecting animals Surviving rabbits develop strong immunity specific viral variant infected A presumptive diagnosis RHD often made based clinical presentation infection pattern within population post mortem lesions Definitive diagnosis requires detection virus As caliciviruses cannot grown cell culture antibody nucleic acid based methods viral detection often used Complete blood counts rabbits RHD often show low levels white blood cells platelets chemistry panels show elevated liver enzymes Evidence liver failure may also present including increased bile acids bilirubin decreased glucose cholesterol Prolonged prothrombin activated partial thromboplastin times typical Urinalysis show bilirubinuria proteinuria high urinary GGT The classic post mortem lesion seen rabbits RHD extensive hepatic necrosis Multifocal hemorrhages splenomegaly bronchopneumonia pulmonary hemorrhage edema myocardial necrosis may sometimes also seen RTqPCR tests commonly used accurate testing modality RNAbased viruses Other tests used include enzymelinked immunosorbent assay electron microscopy immunostaining Western blot situ hybridization The tissue choice molecular testing fresh frozen liver usually contains largest numbers virus available spleen serum also used Identification strain RHDV
