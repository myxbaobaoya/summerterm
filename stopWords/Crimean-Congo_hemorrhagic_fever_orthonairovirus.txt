Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever CCHF viral disease Symptoms CCHF may include fever muscle pains headache vomiting diarrhea bleeding skin Onset symptoms less two weeks following exposure Complications may include liver failure In survive recovery generally occurs around two weeks onset The CCHF virus typically spread tick bites close contact blood secretions organs bodily fluids infected persons animals Groups high risk infection farmers work slaughterhouses The virus also spread people via body fluids Diagnosis made detecting antibodies viruss RNA viral proteins antigens It type viral hemorrhagic fever There FDA WHOapproved therapeutics CCHF Prevention involves avoiding tick bites using safe practices meat processing plants observing universal healthcare precautions A vaccine commercially available Treatment typically supportive care The medication ribavirin may also help CCHF cases observed wide geographic range including Africa Russia Balkans Middle East Asia Typically small outbreaks seen areas virus endemic In Iran Russia Turkey Uzbekistan documented cases The fatality rate typically though fatalities high observed outbreaks The virus first observed Crimea later identified agent called Congo Hemorrhagic Fever In past years CCHF outbreaks reported Eastern Europe particularly former Soviet Union throughout Mediterranean northwestern China central Asia southern Europe Africa Middle East Indian subcontinent CCHF WHOs priority list Research Development US National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases NIHNIAID priority A list disease posing highest level risk national security public health The clinical illness associated CCHFV severe form hemorrhagic fever Following infection tick bite incubation period typically two three days last long nine days incubation period following contact infected blood tissues usually five six days documented maximum days The onset symptoms ushering prehemmorhagic phase sudden fever myalgia muscle ache dizziness neck pain stiffness backache headache Suhash disease sore eyes photophobia sensitivity light Typical symptoms include nausea vomiting may progress severe bleeding fatal treated diarrhea abdominal pain sore throat early acute infection phase followed sharp mood swings agitations confusion After several days agitation may replaced sleepiness depression lassitude abdominal pain may localize upper right quadrant detectable liver enlargement As illness progresses hemorrhagic phase large areas severe bruising severe nosebleeds uncontrolled bleeding injection sites seen beginning fourth day illness lasting two weeks Other clinical signs include tachycardia fast heart rate lymphadenopathy enlarged lymph nodes petechiae rash caused bleeding skin internal mucosal surfaces mouth throat skin The petechiae may give way larger rashes called ecchymoses haemorrhagic phenomena There usually evidence hepatitis severely ill patients may experience rapid kidney deterioration liver failure pulmonary failure fifth day illness In documented outbreaks CCHF fatality rates hospitalized patients ranged high though WHO notes typical range death often occurring second week illness In patients recover improvement generally begins ninth tenth day onset illness The longterm effects CCHF infection studied well enough survivors determine whether specific complications exist However recovery slow The CrimeanCongo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus CCHFV member genus Orthonairovirus family Nairoviridae RNA viruses The virions – nanometers nm diameter pleomorphic There host ribosomes within virion Each virion contains three distinct RNA sequences together make viral genome The envelope single layered formed lipid bilayer nm thick It external protrusions The envelope proteins form small projections – nm long The nucleocapsids filamentous circular length – nm Viral entry thought clathrinmediated cell surface protein nucleolin playing role The genome circular negative sense RNA three parts – Small S Medium M Large L The L segment – kilobases length M S segments – – kilobases long respectively The L segment encodes RNA polymerase M segment encodes envelope glycoproteins Gc Gn S segment encodes nucleocapsid protein The mutation rates three parts genome estimated ×− ×− ×− substitutionssiteyear S M L segments respectively CCHFV genetically diverse arboviruses Its nucleotide sequences frequently differ different strains ranging variability viral S segment M segment Viruses diverse sequences found within geographic area closely related viruses isolated widely separated regions suggesting viral dispersion occurred possibly ticks carried migratory birds international livestock trade Reassortment among genome segments coinfection ticks vertebrates seems likely played role generating diversity viruscitation needed Based sequence data seven genotypes CCHFV recognised Africa Senegal Africa Democratic Republic Congo South Africa Africa southern western Africa Europe

rats "amplifying hosts" virus Birds generally resistant CCHF exception ostriches Domestic animals like sheep goats cattle develop high titers virus blood tend fall ill The "sporadic infection" humans usually caused Hyalomma tick bite Animals transmit virus humans would usually part disease cluster When clusters illness occur typically people treat butcher eat infected livestock particularly ruminants ostriches Outbreaks occurred abattoirs places workers exposed infected human animal blood fomitescitation needed Humans infect humans outbreaks also occur clinical facilities infected blood unclean medical instruments Where mammalian tick infection common agricultural regulations require deticking farm animals transportation delivery slaughter Personal tick avoidance measures recommended use insect repellents adequate clothing body inspection adherent tickscitation needed When feverish patients evidence bleeding require resuscitation intensive care body substance isolation precautions takencitation needed Since several vaccine trials around world CCHF terminated due high toxicity As March update available probably somewhat efficacious CCHF vaccine inactivated antigen preparation used Bulgaria No publication scientific literature related vaccine exists Turkish virologist called suspicious antiquated technology mouse brain used manufacture More vaccines development sporadic nature disease even endemic countries suggests large trials vaccine efficacy difficult perform Finding volunteers may prove challenging given growing antivaccination sentiment resistance populations vaccination contagious diseases The number people vaccinated length time would followed confirm protection would carefully defined Alternatively many scientists appear believe treatment CCHF ribavirin practical prevention recently conducted clinical trials appear counter assumptions drug efficacy In Turkish research team led Erciyes University successfully developed first nontoxic preventive vaccine passed clinical trials As vaccine pending approval US FDA Since Ebola epidemic WHO jumpstarted "Blueprint Research Development preparedness" emerging pathogens epidemic potential medical
