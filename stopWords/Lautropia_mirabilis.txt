Lautropia mirabilis Gramnegative, facultatively anaerobic, oxidase catalasepositive, motile bacterium genus Lautropia family Burkholderiaceae, isolated mouth children infected human immunodeficiency virus. Lautropia mirabilis gramnegative, polymorphic, motile, coccoid bacteria, commonly found human oral cavity upper respiratory tract. It first isolated identified Sarcina mirabilis. However, status unique species proposed , rediscovered samples gingival margins healthy human patients. Its status new species validated International Journal Systematic Evolutionary Microbiology. L. mirabilis grown nonselective media except egg yolk agar. Furthermore, L. mirabilis inoculated onto selective media, growth observed. When grown broth culture, granules typically observed loosely adhering side tube. The species mesophile, optimum growth restricted °C. As facultative anaerobe, L. mirabilis capable growing aerobic anaerobic conditions; however grows best aerobic conditions. Three colony morphologies observed bacteria cultured solid media. Younger colonies tend form flat dry, circular morphology. After one day however, predominant form larger wrinkled morphology. The third colony type smooth, shiny round mucoid surrounding it. Under light microscope, three cellular morphologies observed L mirabilis. The first, capsulated cocci approximately µm diameter, common morphology, independent age culture. The second motile cocci also µm diameter. It typically found edge colony one day culture. Between three nine flagella project cell wall lophotrichous fashion. Finally, third morphology similar sphaeroblast. It µm diameter, typically found older cultures. L. mirabilis isolated cavities children infected Human Immunodeficiency Virus sputum cystic fibrosis patients. Despite findings, numerous studies also found bacterium commonly found healthier patients compared patients periodontitis. These studies suggest L. mirabilis plays role multiple human diseases; however, research required understand functional mechanistic role microorganism diseases. The linear DNA genome Lautropia mirabilis type strain ATCC completely sequenced. There one chromosome length approximately . Mb, plasmids discovered. This genome size small compared species order, like Burkholderiales, may account symbiont relationship humans. The genome total , protein coding genes GC content accounts .. There tRNAs pseudo genes identified. As gram negative bacteria, thin peptidoglycan layer sandwiched three layers either side observed electron microscope. Moreover, majority bacteria within established colony membranous layer exists cells. Many fine, Electrondense granules typically observed bacteria. L. mirabilis normally isolated human dental plaque. Within plaques, bacteria typically lives variety bacteria supragingival subgingival biofilm. Although numbers gram negative bacteria begin dominate development gingivitis, L. mirabilis numbers decrease. L. mirabilis displays pleomorphic nature includes morphologies without flagellum. The bacteria shown include three nine flagellum projecting single point cell wall. This morphology consistent bacteria lophotrichous flagella uses motile transport. No research done elucidate utility flagellum lack thereof. L. mirabilis facultative anaerobe. It capable fermenting glucose, fructose, sucrose mannitol. The bacteria grows best aerobic conditions; however, research aerobicspecific respiration pathways done. The bacteria positive oxidase, catalase urease. Additionally, capable reducing nitrate nitrite. The habitat L. mirabilis gingival margins human oral cavity. As facultative anaerobe, capable living location biofilm. The microbe appears exclusive human oral microbiome. The relationship potentially symbiotic due presence dental plaque well significant presence typically healthy patients. The presence L. mirabilis linked HIVpositive children well sputum one cystic fibrosis patient. The use antibiotics shown effectively reduce growth bacteria inside oral cavity. There currently biotechnological applications microorganisms. The organism known actively produce polysaccharide inoculated sucrose sugar agar plates. There recent research focused L. mirabilis. There been, however, number recent studies identified bacteria healthy patients without periodontitis gingivitis.
