widely distributed nature microbiota animals including human microbiota mostly innocuous commonly existing commensal relationships hosts Some useful industrial settings C glutamicum Others cause human disease including notably diphtheria caused C diphtheriae As various species microbiota including relatives genera Arcanobacterium Trueperella usually pathogenic occasionally opportunistically capitalize atypical access tissues via wounds weakened host defenses The genus Corynebacterium created Lehmann Neumann taxonomic group contain bacterial rods responsible causing diphtheria The genus defined based morphological characteristics Based studies SrRNA grouped subdivision Grampositive Eubacteria high GC content close phylogenetic relationship Arthrobacter Mycobacterium Nocardia Streptomyces The term comes Greek κορύνη korýnē club mace staff knobby plant bud shoot βακτήριον baktḗrion little rod The term "diphtheroids" used represent corynebacteria nonpathogenic example C diphtheriae would excludedcitation needed The term diphtheroid comes Greek διφθέρα diphthérā prepared hide leather Comparative analysis corynebacterial genomes led identification several conserved signature indels CSIs unique genus Two examples CSIs twoaminoacid insertion conserved region enzyme phosphoribose diphosphatedecaprenylphosphate phosphoribosyltransferase threeaminoacid insertion acetate kinase found Corynebacterium species Both indels serve molecular markers species genus Corynebacterium Additionally conserved signature proteins uniquely found Corynebacterium species identified Three homologs found genus Dietzia believed closest related genus Corynebacterium In phylogenetic trees based concatenated protein sequences S rRNA genus Corynebacterium forms distinct clade within distinct subclade cluster I The cluster made species C diphtheriae C pseudotuberculosis C ulcerans C aurimucosum C glutamicum C efficiens This cluster distinguished several conserved signature indels twoaminoacid insertion LepA seven eightaminoacid insertions RpoC Also conserved signature proteins found members cluster I Another cluster proposed consisting C jeikeium C urealyticum supported presence distinct conserved signature proteins unique two species Corynebateria high GC content ranging mol The principal features genus Corynebacterium described Collins Cummins They grampositive catalasepositive nonsporeforming nonmotile rodshaped bacteria straight slightly curved Metachromatic granules usually present representing stored phosphate regions Their size falls μm length μm diameter The bacteria group together characteristic way described form "V" "palisades" "Chinese characters" They may also appear elliptical They aerobic facultatively anaerobic chemoorganotrophs They pleomorphic lifecycles occur various lengths frequently thickenings either end depending surrounding conditions Some corynebacteria lipophilic CDC coryneform groups F G C accolens C afermentans subsp lipophilum C bovis C jeikeium C macginleyi C uropygiale C urealyticum notcitation needed The nonlipophilic bacteria may classified fermentative C amycolatum C argentoratense members C diphtheriae group C glucuronolyticum C glutamicum C matruchotii C minutissimum C striatum C xerosis nonfermentative C afermentans subsp afermentans C auris C pseudodiphtheriticum C propinquum The cell wall distinctive predominance mesodiaminopimelic acid murein wall many repetitions arabinogalactan well corynemycolic acid mycolic acid carbon atoms bound disaccharide bonds called LRhap → DGlcNAcphosphate These form complex commonly seen Corynebacterium species mycolylAG–peptidoglican mAGP Unlike corynebacteria Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii contain mycolic acids Corynebacteria grow slowly even enriched media In nutritional requirements need biotin grow Some strains also need thiamine PABA Some Corynebacterium species sequenced genomes million base pairs The bacteria grow Loefflers medium blood agar trypticase soy agar TSA They form small grayish colonies granular appearance mostly translucent opaque centers convex continuous borders The color tends yellowishwhite Loefflers medium In TSA form grey colonies black centers dentated borders either resemble flowers C gravis continuous borders C mitis mix two forms C intermedium Corynebacterium species occur commonly nature soil water plants food products The nondiphtheiroid Corynebacterium species even found mucosa normal skin flora humans animals Unusual habitats preen gland birds recently reported Corynebacterium uropygiale Some species known pathogenic effects humans animals Perhaps notable one C diphtheriae acquires capacity produce diphtheria toxin interacting bacteriophage Other pathogenic species humans include C amycolatum C striatum C jeikeium C urealyticum C xerosis important pathogens immunosuppressed patients Pathogenic species animals include C bovis C renale This genus found part human salivary microbiome The notable human infection diphtheria caused C diphtheriae It acute contagious infection characterized pseudomembranes dead epithelial cells white blood cells red blood cells fibrin form around tonsils back throat In developed countries uncommon illness tends occur unvaccinated individuals especially schoolaged children elderly neutropenic immunocompromised patients prosthetic devices prosthetic heart valves shunts catheters It common developing countries It occasionally infect wounds vulva conjunctiva middle ear It spread within hospital The virulent toxigenic strains produce exotoxin formed two polypeptide chains produced bacterium transformed gene β prophage Several species cause disease animals notably C pseudotuberculosis causes disease caseous lymphadenitis also pathogenic humans Some attack healthy hosts others tend attack immunocompromised Effects infection include granulomatous lymphadenopathy pneumonitis pharyngitis skin infections endocarditis Corynebacterial endocarditis seen frequently patients intravascular devices Several species Corynebacterium cause trichomycosis axillaris C striatum may cause axillary odor C minutissimum causes erythrasma Nonpathogenic species Corynebacterium used important industrial applications production amino acids nucleotides nutritional factors Martín bioconversion steroids degradation hydrocarbons cheese aging production enzymes Some species produce metabolites similar antibiotics bacteriocins corynecinlinocin type antitumor agents etc One studied species C glutamicum whose name refers capacity produce glutamic acid aerobic conditions This used food industry monosodium glutamate production soy sauce yogurtcitation needed Species Corynebacterium used mass production various amino acids including glutamic acid food additive made rate million tons year The metabolic pathways Corynebacterium manipulated produce lysine threoninecitation needed LLysine production specific C glutamicum core metabolic enzymes manipulated genetic engineering drive metabolic flux towards production NADPH pentose phosphate pathway Laspartyl phosphate commitment step synthesis Llysine lysC dapA dapC dapF These enzymes upregulated industry genetic engineering ensure adequate amounts lysine precursors produced increase metabolic flux Unwanted side reactions threonine asparagine production occur buildup intermediates occurs scientists developed mutant strains C glutamicum PCR engineering chemical knockouts ensure production sidereaction enzymes limited Many genetic manipulations conducted industry traditional crossover methods inhibition transcriptional activators Expression functionally active human epidermal growth factor brought C glutamicum thus demonstrating potential industrialscale production human proteins Expressed proteins targeted secretion either general secretory pathway twinarginine translocation
