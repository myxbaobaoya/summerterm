Rotavirus genus doublestranded RNA viruses family Reoviridae Rotaviruses common cause diarrhoeal disease among infants young children Nearly every child world infected rotavirus least age five Immunity develops infection subsequent infections less severe Adults rarely affected There nine species genus referred A B C D F G H I J Rotavirus A common species causes rotavirus infections humans The virus transmitted faecaloral route It infects damages cells line small intestine causes gastroenteritis often called "stomach flu" despite relation influenza Although Rotavirus discovered Ruth Bishop colleagues electron micrograph images accounts approximately one third hospitalisations severe diarrhoea infants children importance historically underestimated within public health community particularly developing countries In addition impact human health rotavirus also infects animals pathogen livestock Rotaviral enteritis usually easily managed disease childhood rotaviruses caused percent deaths children diarrhoea deaths worldwide almost two million became severely ill Most deaths occurred developing countries In United States initiation rotavirus vaccination programme rotavirus caused million cases severe gastroenteritis children almost hospitalisations around deaths year Following rotavirus vaccine introduction United States hospitalisation rates fallen
