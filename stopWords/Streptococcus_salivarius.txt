Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus Andrewes Horder Streptococcus salivarius species spherical, grampositive, facultative anaerobic bacteria catalase oxidase negative. S. salivarius colonizes usually chains oral cavity upper respiratory tract humans hours birth, making exposure bacteria harmless circumstances. The bacteria considered opportunistic pathogen, rarely finding way bloodstream, implicated cases sepsis people neutropenia, deficiency white blood cells. S. salivarius distinct characteristics exposed different environmental nutrients. For example, laboratory, growth medium used includes sucrose S. salivarius able use sucrose produce capsule around itself. However, sucrose replaced glucose GYC glucose, yeast extract, calcium carbonate plate, S. salivarius unable make capsule glucose. More importantly, laboratory, S. salivarius show distinct clearing GYC plates. This S. salivarius ferment glucose yielding lactic acid. Next, lactic acid actually reacts calcium carbonate GYC plate, resulting zones clearings plate. Some strains S. salivarius trialed use probiotic prevention oral infections. Some strains S. salivarius found produce BLIS Bacteriocinlike Inhibitory Substances antimicrobial peptides. These peptides display interspecies inhibition, inhibit Streptococcus pyogenes causes strep throat infections. Lozenges containing S. salivarius marketed support immunity virulent Streptococcus strains. People strain naturally occurring S. salivarius tongue shown fewer Strep throat infections. This also investigated potential prevent rheumatic heart disease also caused S. pyogenes. Agglutination Streptococcus salivarius often used diagnosis atypical pneumonia caused Haemophilus influenzae Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, also known Streptococcus thermophilus, subspecies S. salivarius.
