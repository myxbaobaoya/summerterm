Rubella virus RuV pathogenic agent disease rubella transmitted humans via respiratory route main cause congenital rubella syndrome infection occurs first weeks pregnancy Rubella virus scientific name Rubivirus rubellae member genus Rubivirus belongs family Matonaviridae whose members commonly genome singlestranded RNA positive polarity enclosed icosahedral capsid As update molecular basis causation congenital rubella syndrome yet completely clear vitro studies cell lines showed rubella virus apoptotic effect certain cell types There evidence pdependent mechanism Rubella virus Rubivirus rubellae assigned Rubivirus genus Until Rubiviruses classified part family Togaviridae since changed sole genus family Matonaviridae This family named George de Maton first distinguished rubella measles scarlet fever The change made International Committee Taxonomy Viruses ICTV central governing body viral classification Matonaviridae remains part realm already Togaviridae Riboviria RNA genome RNA dependent RNA polymerase In Ruhugu virus Rustrela virus joined Rubella virus second third three members genus Rubivirus Neither known infect people While alphavirus virions spherical contain icosahedral nucleocapsid RuV virions pleiomorphic contain icosahedral nucleocapsids ICTV analyzed sequence RuV compared phylogeny togaviruses They concludedPhylogenetic analysis RNAdependent RNA polymerase alphaviruses rubella virus positivesense RNA viruses shows two genera within Togaviridae monophyletic In particular rubella virus groups closely members families Benyviridae Hepeviridae Alphatetraviridae along several unclassified viruses members family Togaviridae belonging genus Alphavirus The spherical virus particles virions Matonaviridae diameter nm covered lipid membrane viral envelope derived host cell membrane There prominent "spikes" projections nm composed viral envelope proteins E E embedded membrane The E glycoprotein considered immunodominant humoral response induced structural proteins contains neutralizing hemagglutinating determinants Inside lipid envelope capsid nm diameter The capsid protein CP different functions Its main tasks formation homooligomeres form capsid binding genomic RNA Further responsible aggregation RNA capsid interacts membrane proteins E E binds human hostprotein p important replication virus host As opposed alphaviruses capsid undergo autoproteolysis rather cut rest polyprotein signalpeptidase Production capsid happens surface intracellular membranes simultaneously budding virus The genome nucleotides encodes nonstructural polypeptides p p within ′terminal twothirds structural polypeptides C E E within ′terminal onethird Both envelope proteins E E glycosylated There three sites highly conserved Matonaviruses stemandloop structure end genome nucleotide conserved sequence near end genome nucleotide conserved sequence subgenomic RNA start site Homologous sequences present rubella genome The genome encodes several noncoding RNA structures among rubella virus cisacting element contains multiple stemloops one found essential viral replication The significant region homology rubella alphaviruses located NH terminus non structural protein This sequence helicase replicase activity In rubella genome occur opposite orientation found alphaviruses indicating genome rearrangement occurred The genome highest GC content currently known single stranded RNA virus Despite high GC content codon use similar human host The viruses attach cell surface via specific receptors taken endosome formed At neutral pH outside cell E envelope protein covers E protein The dropping pH inside endosome frees outer domain E causes fusion viral envelope endosomal membrane Thus capsid reaches cytosol decays releases genome The ssRNA positive singlestranded RNA first acts template translation nonstructural proteins synthesized large polyprotein cut single proteins The sequences structural proteins first replicated viral RNA polymerase Replicase via complementary ssRNA template translated separate short mRNA This short subgenomic RNA additionally packed virion Translation structural proteins produces large polypeptide Dalton This endoproteolytically cut E E capsid protein E E type I transmembrane proteins transported endoplasmatic reticulum ER help Nterminal signal sequence From ER heterodimeric E·Ecomplex reaches Golgi apparatus budding new virions occurs unlike alpha viruses budding occurs plasma membrane The capsid proteins hand stay cytoplasm interact genomic RNA together forming capsid RuV transmitted via respiration humans On basis differences sequence E protein two genotypes described differ These subdivided recognised genotypes B C D E F G h j A B C For typing WHO recommends minimum window includes
