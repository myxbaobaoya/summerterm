Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron formerly Bacillus thetaiotaomicron species bacterium genus Bacteroides. It gramnegative obligate anaerobe. It one common bacteria found human gut microbiota also opportunistic pathogen. Its genome contains numerous genes specialized digestion polysaccharides. It often used research model organism functional studies human microbiota. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron first described name Bacillus thetaiotaomicron moved genus Bacteroides . It originally isolated adult human feces. The specific name derives Greek letters theta, iota, omicron; List Prokaryotic names Standing Nomenclature indicates "relating morphology vacuolated forms". The name used example "arbitrary" species name International Code Nomenclature Prokaryotes. The genome B. thetaiotaomicron sequenced . It . megabases length, relatively small number distinct genes, due many genes coding proteins unusually large compared prokaryotes. This genomic feature shared another member genus similar lifestyle, Bacteroides fragilis. The genome notable containing large numbers genes associated breaking polysaccharides, including glycoside hydrolases starch binding proteins. The genome also contains large numbers genes encoding proteins involved sensing responding extracellular environment, sigma factors twocomponent systems. The B. thetaiotaomicron genome also encodes large number small noncoding RNAs, though characterized date. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron capable metabolizing diverse range polysaccharides. Its complement enzymes hydrolysis glycosidic bonds among largest known prokaryotes, thought capable hydrolyzing glycosidic bonds biological polysaccharides. As component human gut flora, use dietary carbohydrates sourced host, depending nutrient availability. Although considered obligate anaerobe, B. thetaiotaomicron aerotolerant survive, grow, exposed oxygen. It expresses number proteins scavenge reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide exposed air. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron one common components human gut flora. In longterm study Bacteroides species clinical samples, B. thetaiotaomicron second common species isolated, behind Bacteroides fragilis. B. thetaiotaomicron considered commensal symbiotic. However, also opportunistic pathogen infect tissues exposed gut flora. Its polysaccharidemetabolizing abilities make food source components microbiome. For example, B. thetaiotaomicron expresses sialidase enzymes, cannot catabolize sialic acid; result presence increases free sialic acid available organisms gut. These interactions contribute growth pathogenic bacteria Clostridium difficile, uses sialic acid carbon source. Similar interactions cause B. thetaiotaomicron exacerbate pathogenic E. coli infection.
