Sapovirus genetically diverse genus singlestranded positivesense RNA nonenveloped viruses within family Caliciviridae Together norovirus sapoviruses common cause acute gastroenteritis commonly called "stomach flu" although related influenza humans animals It monotypic taxon containing one species Sapporo virus Natural hosts virus humans swine The virus transmitted oralfecal contact Sapovirus commonly occurs children infants therefore often spread nurseries daycares however also found longterm care facilities This could due lack personal hygiene sanitation measures Common symptoms include diarrhea vomiting The sapovirus initially discovered outbreak gastroenteritis orphanage Sapporo Japan Sapovirus spread via fecaloral route Infected individuals expel \displaystyle particlesgram feces vomit Particles infected individual remain viable years infectious dose particles Contamination work surfaces hands etc cause vast number new infections Infection may occur particles inhaled particles aerosolized infected vomit toilet flushed infected individual vomits Other forms transmission include excessive handling foods infected individual commonly occurs restaurant setting consumption shellfish lived waters contaminated infected fecal matter ingestion water contaminated After incubation period – days signs illness start arise Symptoms sapovirus similar norovirus The common symptoms vomiting diarrhea however additional symptoms may occur These include chills nausea headache abdominal cramps myalgiafever rare While patients frequently start show symptoms – day incubation period cases individual asymptomatic Although individual show symptoms still capable spreading virus general mode transmission oralfecal route General sanitary hygiene important method preventing sapovirus This done thoroughly washing hands using restroom eatingpreparing food Contaminated surfaces cleaned disinfectant solutions containing bleach Other preventative measures include avoiding contact sharing drinksfood infected individuals There specific medication individuals infected sapovirus Sapovirus cannot treated antibiotics bacterial infection Treatments include symptom support rehydrating individual Sapovirus nonenveloped positivesense singlestranded RNA virus kb size The virus end polyAtail cap Sapovirus icosahedral structure contains subunits T The diameter capsid – nm Like caliciviruses capsid sapovirus round intends surface However "Star David" surface morphology distinguishes caliciviruses Sapovirus genome organized two possibly three wellknown open reading frames ORFs ORF encodes nonstructural proteins VP main capsid protein VP two standard domains shell S protruding P The S proteins function "form scaffold around nucleic acid" P protein important forming "homodimer receptors" ORF encodes minor structural polyproteins VP While predictions third ORF ORF proof function There least complete genomes sapovirus analyzed identified already classified five categories GIGV divided different genetic clusters Four five groups GI GII GIV GV infect humans four groups correspond four antigenically distinct strains sapovirus Sapporo Houston London Stockholm While least genotypes virus new ones continue reported America Asia Europe ReversetranscriptionPCR RTPCR commonly used detection tool sapovirus broad reactivity sensitivity speed specificity Because diversity sapovirus hundreds primers designed order specifically target amplify RNAdependent RNApolymerase This used "partially characterize Sapovirus investigate similarity detected Sapovirus" "Sapoviruses morphologically distinguishable gastroenteritis pathogens eg norovirus rotavirus astrovirus adenovirus typical "Star David" surface morphology electron microscope However low sensitivity compared nucleic acid detection methods" Enzymelinked immunosorbent assays ELISA used detect human sapovirus clinical samples While ELISA used detect human sapovirus antigens commonly used The diversity many strains sapovirus make difficult detect wide array antigens may presentbecause many antigens possible ELISA accurate sensitive nucleic acid detection methods The exact replication cycle sapovirus determined however thought similar cytoplasmic replication cycle caliciviruses display The cytoplasmic replication cycle follows Using electron microscopy sapovirus first seen diarrheic stool samples United Kingdom soon known gastroenteritis pathogen While virus first seen UK "the prototype strain genus Sapovirus another outbreak Sapporo Japan " The first complete genome sapovirus interpreted Manchester strain United Kingdom Formerly sapoviruses called "Sapporolike viruses" however changed species Sapporo virus genus Sapovirus family Caliciviridae "Currently family Caliciviridae consists five established genera Sapovirus Norovirus Lagovirus Vesivirus Nebovirus" One positive result sapovirus infection confirmed Gisborne Hospital New Zealand Two additional cases found staff members five additional patients put isolation Hospital staff used precautionary measures using personal protection entering rooms faculty members college Taipei County diagnosed sapovirus infections "Using data Oregon Minnesota public health departments researchers investigated gastroenteritis outbreaks Of outbreaks percent found norovirusnegative tested gastrointestinal viruses including sapovirus astrovirus adenovirus rotavirus sapovirus identified outbreaks percent percent occurring long term care facilities Close half cases occurred alone" The researchers explain proportion sapovirus occurring long term care facilities high likely artifact legally mandated outbreak reporting Norovirus commonly associated sapovirus Norovirus sapovirus genomes closely related distinction two made differences coding strategy reading frames Noroviruses along sapoviruses common cause gastroenteritis therefore show symptoms Astrovirus like sapovirus causes gastroenteritis children elderly especially immunocompromised While sapovirus two ORFs Astrovirus three also recombinant strains Astrovirus replicates within cytoplasm propagated readily GI tract Rotavirus like norovirus astrovirus sapovirus causes gastroenteritis Rotavirus however much lethal causing deaths children diarrhea deaths worldwide Sapoviruses identified bats California sea lions dogs pigs mink
