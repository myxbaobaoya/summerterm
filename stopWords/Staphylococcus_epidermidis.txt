Staphylococcus albus Rosenbach Staphylococcus epidermidis Grampositive bacterium one species belonging genus Staphylococcus It part normal human flora typically skin flora less commonly mucosal flora also found marine sponges It facultative anaerobic bacteria Although S epidermidis usually pathogenic patients compromised immune systems risk developing infection These infections generally hospitalacquired S epidermidis particular concern people catheters surgical implants known form biofilms grow devices Being part normal skin flora S epidermidis frequent contaminant specimens sent diagnostic laboratory Some strains S epidermidis highly salt tolerant commonly found marine environment SI Paul et al isolated identified salt tolerant strains S epidermidis strains ISPA ISPB ISPC Cliona viridis sponges Saint Martins Island Area Bay Bengal Bangladesh Staphylococcus bunch grapelike berries epidermidis epidermis Friedrich Julius Rosenbach distinguished S epidermidis S aureus initially naming S epidermidis S albus He chose aureus albus since bacteria formed yellow white colonies respectively Staphylococcus epidermidis hardy microorganism consisting nonmotile Grampositive cocci arranged grapelike clusters It forms white raised cohesive colonies – mm diameter overnight incubation hemolytic blood agar It catalasepositive coagulasenegative facultative anaerobe grow aerobic respiration fermentation Some strains may ferment Biochemical tests indicate microorganism also carries weakly positive reaction nitrate reductase test It positive urease production oxidase negative use glucose sucrose lactose form acid products In presence lactose also produce gas Nonpathogenic S epidermidis unlike pathogenic S aureus possess gelatinase enzyme cannot hydrolyze gelatin It sensitive novobiocin providing important test distinguish Staphylococcus saprophyticus coagulasenegative well novobiocinresistant Similar S aureus cell walls S epidermidis transferrinbinding protein helps organism obtain iron transferrin The tetramers surface exposed protein glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase believed bind transferrin remove iron Subsequent steps include iron transferred surface lipoproteins transport proteins carry iron cell Colony morphological physiological biochemical characteristics marine S epidermidis shown table Note Positive – Negative W Weakly Positive The ability form biofilms plastic devices major virulence factor S epidermidis One probable cause surface proteins bind blood extracellular matrix proteins It produces extracellular material known polysaccharide intercellular adhesin PIA made sulfated polysaccharides It allows bacteria bind already existing biofilm creating multilayer biofilm Such biofilms decrease metabolic activity bacteria within This decreased metabolism combination impaired diffusion antibiotics makes difficult antibiotics effectively clear type infection S epidermidis strains often resistant antibiotics including rifamycin fluoroquinolones gentamicin tetracycline clindamycin sulfonamides Methicillin resistance particularly widespread hospital isolates resistance methicillin Resistant organisms commonly found intestine organisms living freely skin also become resistant due routine exposure antibiotics secreted sweat As mentioned S epidermidis causes biofilms grow plastic devices placed within body This occurs commonly intravenous catheters medical prostheses Infection also occur dialysis patients anyone implanted plastic device may contaminated It also causes endocarditis often patients defective heart valves In cases sepsis occur hospital patientscitation needed Antibiotics largely ineffective clearing biofilms The common treatment infections remove replace infected implant though cases prevention ideal The drug choice often vancomycin rifampin aminoglycoside addedcitation needed Hand washing shown reduce spread infection Preliminary research also indicates S epidermidis universally found inside affected acne vulgaris pores Cutibacterium acnes normally sole resident Staphylococcus epidermidis normal skin nonpathogenic But abnormal lesions becomes pathogenic likely acne vulgaris Staphylococcus epidermidis enters sebaceous gland colonized Propionibacterium acnes main bacterium causes acne vulgaris damages hair follicles producing lipolytic enzymes change sebum fraction dense thick form leading inflammatory effect Moreover S epidermidis biofilm formation releasing exopolysaccharide intercellular adhesion PIA provides susceptible anaerobic environment P acnes colonisation protects innate human immunity molecules Both P acnes S epidermidis interact protect host skin health pathogens colonisation But case competition use carbon source ie glycerol produce short chain fatty acids act antibacterial agent Also S epidermidis helps skin homeostasis reduces P acnes pathogenic inflammation decreasing TLR protein production induces skin inflammation The normal practice detecting S epidermidis using appearance colonies selective media bacterial morphology light microscopy catalase slide coagulase testing Zobell agar useful isolation Staphylococcus epidermidis marine organisms On BairdParker agar egg yolk supplement colonies appear small black Increasingly techniques quantitative PCR employed rapid detection identification Staphylococcus strains Normally sensitivity desferrioxamine also used distinguish staphylococci except case Staphylococcus hominis also sensitive In case production acid trehalose S hominis used tell two species apart
