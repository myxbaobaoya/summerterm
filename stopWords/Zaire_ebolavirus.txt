Zaire ebolavirus commonly known Ebola virus iˈboʊlə ɪ EBOV one six known species within genus Ebolavirus Four six known ebolaviruses including EBOV cause severe often fatal hemorrhagic fever humans mammals known Ebola virus disease EVD Ebola virus caused majority human deaths EVD cause – epidemic western Africa resulted least suspected cases confirmed deaths Ebola virus genus originally named Zaire Democratic Republic Congo country first described first suspected new "strain" closely related Marburg virus The virus renamed "Ebola virus" avoid confusion Ebola virus single member species Zaire ebolavirus assigned genus Ebolavirus family Filoviridae order Mononegavirales The members species called Zaire ebolaviruses The natural reservoir Ebola virus believed bats particularly fruit bats primarily transmitted humans animals humans body fluids The EBOV genome singlestranded RNA approximately nucleotides long It encodes seven structural proteins nucleoprotein NP polymerase cofactor VP VP GP transcription activator VP VP RNAdependent RNA polymerase L Because high fatality rate percent EBOV also listed select agent World Health Organization Risk Group Pathogen requiring Biosafety

hosts reported "various species fruit bats throughout central subSaharan Africa" Evidence infection bats detected molecular serologic means However ebolaviruses isolated bats End hosts humans great apes infected bat contact end hosts Pigs Philippines reported infected Reston virus interim amplifying hosts may exist Ebola virus outbreaks tend occur temperatures lower humidity higher usual Africa Even person recovers acute phase disease Ebola virus survives months certain organs eyes testes Zaire ebolavirus one four ebolaviruses known cause disease humans It highest casefatality rate ebolaviruses averaging percent since first outbreaks although fatality rate percent recorded one outbreak Republic Congo December April There also outbreaks Zaire ebolavirus ebolavirus The first outbreak occurred August Yambuku The first recorded case Mabalo Lokela ‑yearold schoolteacher The symptoms resembled malaria subsequent patients received quinine Transmission attributed reuse unsterilized needles close personal contact body fluids places person touched During Ebola outbreak Zaire Ngoy Mushola travelled Bumba Yambuku recorded first clinical description disease daily log The illness characterized high temperature °C hematemesis diarrhea blood retrosternal abdominal pain prostration "heavy" articulations rapid evolution death mean three daysSince first recorded clinical description disease Zaire recent Ebola outbreak started March addition reached epidemic proportions killed people January This outbreak centered West Africa area previously affected disease The toll particularly grave three countries Guinea Liberia Sierra Leone A cases also reported countries outside West Africa related international travelers exposed affected regions later showed symptoms Ebola fever reaching destinations The severity disease humans varies widely rapid fatality mild illness even asymptomatic response Studies outbreaks late twentieth century failed find correlation disease severity genetic nature virus Hence variability severity illness suspected correlate genetic differences victims This difficult study animal models respond virus hemorrhagic fever similar manner humans typical mouse models respond required large numbers appropriate test subjects easily available In late October publication reported study response mouseadapted strain Zaire ebolavirus presented genetically diverse population mice bred range responses virus includes fatality hemorrhagic fever In December study found VSVEBOV vaccine – effective Ebola virus making first vaccine disease VSVEBOV approved US Food Drug Administration December Ebola virus first identified possible new "strain" Marburg virus The International Committee Taxonomy Viruses ICTV identifies Ebola virus species Zaire ebolavirus part genus Ebolavirus family Filoviridae order Mononegavirales The name "Ebola virus" derived Ebola Rivera river first thought close proximity area Democratic Republic Congo previously called Zaire Zaire Ebola virus outbreak occurredand taxonomic suffix virus In virus name changed "Zaire Ebola virus" species Zaire ebolavirus However scientific articles continued refer "Ebola virus" used terms "Ebola virus" "Zaire ebolavirus" parallel Consequently group researchers recommended name "Ebola virus" adopted subclassification within species Zaire ebolavirus corresponding abbreviation EBOV Previous abbreviations virus EBOVZ "Ebola virus Zaire" ZEBOV "Zaire Ebola virus" "Zaire ebolavirus" In ICTV explicitly rejected proposal bV recognize name ICTV designate names subtypes variants strains subspecies level groupings At present ICTV officially recognize "Ebola virus" taxonomic rank rather continues use recommend species designation Zaire ebolavirus The prototype Ebola virus variant Mayinga EBOVMay named Mayinga NSeka nurse died Zaire outbreak The name Zaire ebolavirus derived Zaire taxonomic suffix ebolavirus denotes ebolavirus species refers Ebola River According rules taxon naming established International Committee Taxonomy Viruses ICTV name Zaire ebolavirus always capitalized italicized preceded word "species" The names members Zaire ebolaviruses capitalized italicized used without articles A virus genus Ebolavirus member species Zaire ebolavirus Zaire ebolavirus diverged ancestors The genetic diversity Ebolavirus remained constant Then around likely due climate change human activities genetic diversity virus dropped rapidly lineages became extinct As number susceptible hosts declines effective population size genetic diversity This genetic bottleneck effect implications species ability cause Ebola virus disease human hostscitation needed A recombination event Zaire ebolavirus lineages likely took place wild apes giving rise recombinant progeny viruses These recombinant viruses appear responsible series outbreaks among humans Central Africa – Zaire ebolavirus – Makona variant caused West Africa outbreak The outbreak characterized longest
